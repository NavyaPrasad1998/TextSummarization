              "\t<tr><td>Inter-Prediction is used effectively in multiple standards, including H.264 and HEVC (also known as H.265). It leverages correlation between blocks of consecutive video frames in order to perform motion compensation and thus predict block pixel values and reduce transmission bandwidth. In order to reduce the magnitude of the transmitted Motion Vector (MV) and thus reduce bandwidth, the encoder utilizes Predicted Motion Vector (PMV), which is derived by taking the median vector of the corresponding MVs of the neighboring blocks. In this research, we propose innovative methods, based on neural networks prediction, for improving the accuracy of the calculated PMV. We begin by showing a straightforward approach of calculating the best matching PMV and signaling its neighbor block index value to the decoder while reducing the number of bits required to represent the result without adding any computation complexity. Then we use a classification Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) to estimate from neighbors the PMV without requiring signaling and show the advantage of the approach when employed for high motion movies. We demonstrate the advantages using fast forward movies. However, the same improvements apply to camera streams of autonomous vehicles, drone cameras, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, and similar applications whereas the MVs magnitudes are expected to be large. We also introduce a regression FCNN to predict the PMV. We calculate Huffman coded streams and demonstrate an order of ~34% reduction in number of bits required to transmit the best matching calculated PMV without reducing the quality, for fast forward movies with high motion.</td><td>Improvements of Motion Estimation and Coding using Neural Networks                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

We point out that the branch of the PBH family that disappeared - PBHs lighter than $\\sim 10^9$g that ostensibly Hawking evaporated away in the early Universe - also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics, for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs.

Both, potential escapers and unbound stars, show hot kinematics, not observed along tidal tails of star clusters.

              "\t<tr><td>Many machine learning applications are based on data collected from people, such as their tastes and behaviour as well as biological traits and genetic data. Regardless of how important the application might be, one has to make sure individuals' identities or the privacy of the data are not compromised in the analysis. Differential privacy constitutes a powerful framework that prevents breaching of data subject privacy from the output of a computation. Differentially private versions of many important Bayesian inference methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of an efficient unified approach applicable to arbitrary models. In this contribution, we propose a differentially private variational inference method with a very wide applicability. It is built on top of doubly stochastic variational inference, a recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of models. We add differential privacy into doubly stochastic variational inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the method can reach an accuracy close to non-private level under reasonably strong privacy guarantees, clearly improving over previous sampling-based alternatives especially in the strong privacy regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>Differentially Private Variational Inference for Non-conjugate Models                                                                 </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>Extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) is the task of selecting a small subset of relevant labels from a very large set of possible labels. As such, it is characterized by long-tail labels, i.e., most labels have very few positive instances. With standard performance measures such as precision@k, a classifier can ignore tail labels and still report good performance. However, it is often argued that correct predictions in the tail are more \"interesting\" or \"rewarding,\" but the community has not yet settled on a metric capturing this intuitive concept. The existing propensity-scored metrics fall short on this goal by confounding the problems of long-tail and missing labels. In this paper, we analyze generalized metrics budgeted \"at k\" as an alternative solution. To tackle the challenging problem of optimizing these metrics, we formulate it in the expected test utility (ETU) framework, which aims to optimize the expected performance on a fixed test set. We derive optimal prediction rules and construct computationally efficient approximations with provable regret guarantees and robustness against model misspecification. Our algorithm, based on block coordinate ascent, scales effortlessly to XMLC problems and obtains promising results in terms of long-tail performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>Generalized test utilities for long-tail performance in extreme   multi-label classification                                          </td></tr>\n",

However, there are no models of science communication that respond to the multiplicity of non-academic channels. Using the 3653 authors with the highest volume of altmetrics mentions from the main channels (Twitter, News, Facebook, Wikipedia, Blog, Policy documents, and Peer reviews) to their publications (2016-2020), it has been analyzed where the audiences of each discipline are located.

We monitored the splitting of the nuclear levels by the hyperfine field at the Co nucleus. The energy of this hyperfine splitting is identified as the order parameter of the ferromagnetic phase transition.

We propose a phoneme length regulator that solves the length mismatch problem between IPA input sequence and monolingual alignment results. Using the phoneme length regulator, we present a FastPitch-based cross-lingual model with IPA symbols as input representations. Our experiments show that language-independent input representations (e.g. IPA symbols), an increasing number of training speakers, and explicit modeling of speech variance information all encourage non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS model to disentangle speaker and language representations. The subjective evaluation shows that our proposed model can achieve decent naturalness and speaker similarity in cross-language voice cloning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>Exploring Timbre Disentanglement in Non-Autoregressive Cross-Lingual   Text-to-Speech                                                 </td></tr>\n",

The polarization dependence of the BXH cross section is also obtained. For BXH, we study analytically and numerically the possible effects of the virtual photons and electrons which enter qed calculations in summing over the intermediate states. For the low photon and electron energies used in the current experiments, we show that the virtual intermediate states produce only very small effects. This is because the uncertainty principle limits the distance that the virtual particles can propagate to be much shorter than the separation between the regions of high electron density in the adjacent atoms. We also find that using the asymptotic form of the scattering wave function causes about a 5-10% error for near forward scattering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>Quantum Electrodynamics of Internal Source X-Ray Holographies:   Bremsstrahlung, Fluorescence, and Multiple Energy X-Ray Holography   </td></tr>\n",

By performing {\\it ab initio} calculations on doped graphene we demonstrate that, while the apparent strength obtained from the slopes of experimental photoemission data is highly anisotropic, the angular dependence of the actual electron-phonon coupling strength in this material is negligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>Van Hove Singularity and Apparent Anisotropy in the Electron-Phonon   Interaction in Graphene                                         </td></tr>\n",

              "\t<tr><td>Inferring causal structures from time series data is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. A major barrier to such inference is the problem of subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurement is much lower than that of causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been proposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve identifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without any parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling arises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile, every hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at some observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure. Based on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the hidden variables and hence achieve identifiability. Following this intuition, we propose a proxy-based causal discovery algorithm. Our algorithm is nonparametric and can achieve full causal identification.

A support vector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly discriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease pathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory power, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the underlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more accurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone.

We also propose a new construction for VT codes, quantify the maximum number of the required parity bits, and show that our approach requires fewer parity bits compared to known results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>Reassembly Codes for the Chop-and-Shuffle Channel                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>The reliability of software that has a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a component is urgently important today given the increasing number of critical applications being deployed with DNNs. The need for reliability raises a need for rigorous testing of the safety and trustworthiness of these systems. In the last few years, there have been a number of research efforts focused on testing DNNs. However the test generation techniques proposed so far lack a check to determine whether the test inputs they are generating are valid, and thus invalid inputs are produced. To illustrate this situation, we explored three recent DNN testing techniques. Using deep generative model based input validation, we show that all the three techniques generate significant number of invalid test inputs. We further analyzed the test coverage achieved by the test inputs generated by the DNN testing techniques and showed how invalid test inputs can falsely inflate test coverage metrics.   To overcome the inclusion of invalid inputs in testing, we propose a technique to incorporate the valid input space of the DNN model under test in the test generation process. Our technique uses a deep generative model-based algorithm to generate only valid inputs. Results of our empirical studies show that our technique is effective in eliminating invalid tests and boosting the number of valid test inputs generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>Distribution-Aware Testing of Neural Networks Using Generative Models                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

These binaries contain a compact object (either a black-hole, a neutron-star, or a planet) and a stellar component. We integrate the full set of tidal equations, which are based on Hut's model for tidal evolution, and we couple them with the angular momentum loss in a stellar wind. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we wish to highlight some interesting evolutionary outcomes of the coupling. When tides are coupled with a non-massive stellar wind, one interesting outcome is that in certain types of binaries, the stellar spin tends to reach a quasi-equilibrium state, where the effect of tides and wind are counteracting each other. When tides are coupled with a massive wind, we parametrize the evolution in terms of the decoupling radius, at which the wind decouples from the star. Even for small decoupling radii this \\emph{wind braking} can drive systems on the main sequence to Roche-lobe overflow that otherwise would fail to do so. Our second aim is to inspect whether simple timescale considerations are a good description of the evolution of the systems. We find that simple timescale considerations, which rely on neglecting the coupling between tides and stellar winds, do not accurately represent the true evolution of compact binaries. The outcome of the coupled evolution of the rotational and orbital elements can strongly differ from simple timescale considerations, as already pointed out by Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2009 in the case of short-period planetary systems.                                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>The coupled effect of tides and stellar winds on the evolution of   compact binaries                                                  </span></td></tr>\n",

We make the observation that the requirement is usually to transmit application layer objects (web pages, images, video frames etc) with low latency, and so it is the object delay rather than the per packet delay which is important. This has fundamental implications for multipath scheduler design. We introduce SOS (Stochastic Object-aware Scheduler), the first multipath scheduler that considers application layer object sizes and their relationship to link uncertainty. We demonstrate that SOS reduces the 95% percentile object delivery delay by 50-100% over production WiFi and LTE links compared to state-of-the art schedulers. We extend SOS to utilize FEC and to handle the scheduling multiple objects in parallel.

We use the MUSE optical integral field spectrograph to acquire spectra at a resolution of R~3000 of the uplink laser beams over the wavelength range of 4750\\AA\\ to 9350\\AA. We report the first detection of laser-induced Raman scattering by N2, O2, CO2, H2O and (tentatively) CH4 molecules in the atmosphere above the astronomical observatory of Cerro Paranal.

Laser-induced Raman scattering is not unique to the observatory of Cerro Paranal, but common to any astronomical telescope employing a laser-guide-star (LGS) system. It is thus essential for any optical spectrograph coupled to a LGS system to handle thoroughly the possibility of a Raman spectral contamination via a proper baffling of the instrument and suitable calibrations procedures. These considerations are particularly applicable for the HARMONI optical spectrograph on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope. At sites hosting multiple telescopes, laser collision prediction tools also ought to account for the presence of Raman emission from the uplink laser beam(s) to avoid the unintentional contamination of observations acquired with telescopes in the vicinity of a LGS system.</td><td>Detection and Implications of Laser-Induced Raman Scattering at   Astronomical Observatories               </td></tr>\n",

Furthermore, the peak of speed of sound is narrowly constrained around two times the nuclear saturation density with the thick neutron skin.

We observe a status transition from the monolayer biolaser to the sub-monolayer biolaser by tuning the specific conjugation. By reducing the fluorophores down to the threshold density (~ 3.2 x 10-13 mol/cm2), we demonstrate an ultimate sensitivity of sub-monolayer biolaser with six orders of magnitude enhancement compared with the monolayer biolasers. We further achieved ultrasensitive immunoassay for Parkinson's disease biomarker, alpha-synuclein, with a lower limit of detection of 0.32 pM in serum. This biosensor with massive fabrication capability at ultralow cost provides a general method for the ultrasensitive disposable biodetection of disease biomarkers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>Sub-monolayer Biolasers: Lower Gain, Higher Sensitivity                                                    </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>Graphene is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moir\\'e superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway towards controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials eliminating need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>Photonic crystals for nano-light in moir\\'e graphene superlattices                                        </td></tr>\n",

The proposed BGCS-CIM scheme considers effective cluster power gain and spatial diversity gain obtained by the additional paths within the indexed cluster to construct an efficient codebook. We also integrate the proposed scheme into a practical system model to create a virtual path between transmitter and receiver where the direct link has been blocked. Thanks to the designed whitening filter, a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error rate (ABER) is derived and used to validate the simulation results.

              "\t<tr><td>This work represents a natural coalescence of two important lines of work: learning mixtures of Gaussians and algorithmic robust statistics. In particular we give the first provably robust algorithm for learning mixtures of any constant number of Gaussians. We require only mild assumptions on the mixing weights (bounded fractionality) and that the total variation distance between components is bounded away from zero. At the heart of our algorithm is a new method for proving dimension-independent polynomial identifiability through applying a carefully chosen sequence of differential operations to certain generating functions that not only encode the parameters we would like to learn but also the system of polynomial equations we would like to solve. We show how the symbolic identities we derive can be directly used to analyze a natural sum-of-squares relaxation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>Settling the Robust Learnability of Mixtures of Gaussians                                                  </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>We have detected [C I] 3P1-3P0 emissions in the gaseous debris disks of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris with the 10 m telescope of the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment, which is the first detection of such emissions. The line profiles of [C I] are found to resemble those of CO(J=3-2) observed with the same telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This result suggests that atomic carbon (C) coexists with CO in the debris disks, and is likely formed by the photodissociation of CO. Assuming an optically thin [C I] emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100 K, the column density of C is evaluated to be (2.2+-0.2)x10^17 and (2.5+-0.7)x10^16 cm^-2 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. The C/CO column density ratio is thus derived to be 54+-19 and 69+-42 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. These ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and diffuse clouds by an order of magnitude. The unusually high ratios of C to CO are likely attributed to a lack of H2 molecules needed to reproduce CO molecules efficiently from C. This result implies a small number of H2 molecules in the gas disk; i.e., there is an appreciable contribution of secondary gas from dust grains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>Detection of submillimeter-wave [C I] emission in gaseous debris disks   of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris      </td></tr>\n",

              "\t<tr><td>It is crucial to understand the extreme intermittency of ocean and lake turbulence and turbulent mixing in order to estimate vertical fluxes of momentum, heat and mass by Osborn-Cox flux-dissipation methods. Vast undersampling errors occur by this method when intermittency is not taken into account. Oceanic turbulence increases intermittency as the result of a self-similar nonlinear cascade covering a wide range of scales, mostly horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for Galactic and oceanic turbulence are in the range 3-7. These values are consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of Kolmogorov (1962) and a length scale range over 3-7 decades from viscous or diffusive to buoyancy or Coriolis force domination, where the measured universal intermittency constant m_u = 0.44, Gibson (1991a), is a result of singularities in multifractal turbulence dissipation networks and their degeneration, Bershadskii and Gibson (1994). Nonlinear cascades of gravitational structure formation produce intermittent lognormal number densities of cosmological objects for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>Intermittency of internal wave shear and turbulence dissipation                                            </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>It is shown that the qualitative model of the high-temperature superconductivity suggested earlier for cuprates and doped picene and based on the idea that the valence electron state depends on the character of the chemical bonds they form and on the Coulomb interaction between the electrons is not only confirmed by the experimental data on iron pnictides but is also improved. From the chemical point of view, the high-temperature superconductivity is associated with additional $\\pi$ bonding along chains of covalently bonded ions via a delocalized $\\pi$ orbital, just like in cuprates. From the physical point of view, as the data on iron pnictides show, the superconductivity is associated with a FeAs layer transition into the state similar to a macroscopic quantum system characterized by a highly correlated electron state, formation of two-dimensional crystals of electron pairs with quantized energy levels, and a strong Coulomb interaction between these crystals. Superconductivity in such a system is accomplished by a two-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional Wigner crystals formed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same quasi-one-dimensional state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to a delocalized $\\pi$ orbital in chemistry. The model applicability to three different classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides) indicates that it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity taking into consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and strong Coulomb interactions between the electrons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>Highly Correlated Electron State and High-Temperature Superconductivity   in Iron Pnictides                </td></tr>\n",

              "\t<tr><td>The presence of stratified layer in atmosphere and ocean leads to buoyant vertical motions, commonly referred to as plumes. It is important to study the mixing dynamics of a plume at a local scale in order to model their evolution and growth. Such a characterization requires measuring the velocity and density of the mixing fluids simultaneously. Here, we present the results of a buoyant plume propagating in a linearly stratified medium with a density difference of 0.5%, thus yielding a buoyancy frequency of N=0.15 s^{-1}. To understand the plume behaviour, statistics such as centerline and axial velocities along varying downstream locations, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and buoyancy flux were measured. The centerline velocity was found to decrease with increase in height. The Reynolds stress and buoyancy flux profiles showed the presence of a unstable layer and the mixing associated within that layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>Dynamics of a buoyant plume in a linearly stratified environment using   simultaneous PIV-PLIF measurements</td></tr>\n",

Commercial-off-the-shelf Kapton varieties, measured at approximately 950 and 120 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (1.2$\\times$10$^4$ and 490 $\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively, can be a significant background source for many current and next-generation ultralow background detectors. This study has found that the dominant contamination is due to the use of dicalcium phosphate (DCP), a nonessential slip additive added during manufacturing.

The spin-parity effect is among the fundamental predictions that have yet to be clearly observed. It is predicted that quantum tunneling is suppressed at zero transverse field if the total spin of the magnetic system is half-integer (Kramers degeneracy) but is allowed in integer spin systems. The Landau-Zener method is used to measure the tunnel splitting as a function of transverse field. Spin-parity dependent tunneling is established by comparing the transverse field dependence of the tunnel splitting of integer and half-integer spin systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>Spin-parity dependent tunneling of magnetization in single-molecule   magnets                              </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>Anisotropy data analysis leaves a significant degeneracy between primeval spectral index (n_s) and cosmic opacity to CMB photons (\\tau). Low--l polarization measures, in principle, can remove it. We perform a likelihood analysis to see how cosmic variance possibly affects such a problem. We find that, for a sufficiently low noise level (\\sigma_{pix}) and if \\tau is not negligibly low, the degeneracy is greatly reduced, while the residual impact of cosmic variance on n_s and \\tau determinations is under control. On the contrary, if \\sigma_{pix} is too high, cosmic variance effects appear to be magnified. We apply general results to specific experiments and find that, if favorable conditions occur, it is possible that a 2--\\sigma detection of a lower limit on \\tau is provided by the SPOrt experiment. Furthermore, if the PLANCK experiment will measure polarization with the expected precision, the error on low--l harmonics is adequate to determine \\tau, without significant magnification of the cosmic variance. This however indicates that high sensitivity might be more important than high resolution in \\tau determinations. We also outline that a determination of \\tau is critical to perform detailed analyses on the nature of dark energy and/or on the presence of primeval gravitational waves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>Cosmic opacity to CMB photons and polarization measurements                                                </td></tr>\n",

We argue that the open magnetic field lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may have their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized by an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it is a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form between the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers further jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of stripe widths $l&gt;l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find that the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the stripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks at a distance $z_{\\rm peak}\\sim 10^6 R_g\\, (\\Gamma_\\infty/30)^2\\, (l_{\\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where $R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ the jet's asymptotic Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by $\\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in distance. The prolonged energy dissipation accounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength spectra commonly observed in jets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of blazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to ~100 pc scales. In GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the photopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components.           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>GRB and blazar jets shining through their stripes                                                          </span></td></tr>\n",

              "\t<tr><td>We show that there are remarkable simplifications when the MHV diagram formalism for N=4 super Yang-Mills is reformulated in momentum twistor space. The vertices are replaced by unity while each propagator becomes a dual superconformal `R-invariant' whose arguments may be read off from the diagram. The momentum twistor MHV rules generate a formula for the full, all-loop planar integrand of the super Yang-Mills S-matrix that is manifestly dual superconformally invariant up to the choice of a reference twistor. We give a general proof of this reformulation and illustrate its use by computing the momentum twistor NMHV and NNMHV tree amplitudes and the integrands of the MHV and NMHV 1-loop and the MHV 2-loop planar amplitudes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>MHV Diagrams in Momentum Twistor Space                                                                     </td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>Solar flares are regularly detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite, however no gamma-ray emission from other stellar eruptions has ever been captured. The Swift detection in April 2014 of a powerful outburst originating from DG CVn, with associated optical and radio emissions, enticed us to search for possible 0.1-100 GeV emission from this flaring nearby binary star using the Fermi/LAT. No gamma-ray emission is detected from DG CVn in 2014, but we report a significant gamma-ray excess in November 2012, at a position consistent with that of the binary. There are no reports of contemporary flaring at other wavelengths from DG CVn or any other source within the error circle of the gamma-ray source. We argue that the gamma-ray flare is more likely to have been associated with a background blazar than with DG CVn and identify a candidate for follow-up study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>Fermi/LAT detection of a transient gamma-ray flare in the vicinity of   the binary star DG CVn             </td></tr>\n",

We study the problem of collaboratively estimating the state of the system when certain nodes are compromised by adversaries. Specifically, we consider a Byzantine adversary model, where a compromised node possesses complete knowledge of the system dynamics and the network, and can deviate arbitrarily from the rules of any prescribed algorithm. We first characterize certain fundamental limitations of any distributed state estimation algorithm in terms of the measurement and communication structure of the nodes. We then develop an attack-resilient, provably correct state estimation algorithm that admits a fully distributed implementation. To characterize feasible network topologies that guarantee success of our proposed technique, we introduce a notion of `strong-robustness' that captures both measurement and communication redundancy. Finally, by drawing connections to bootstrap percolation theory, we argue that given an LTI system and an associated sensor network, the `strong-robustness' property can be checked in polynomial time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Observers for LTI Systems                                                  </td></tr>\n",

It leverages correlation between blocks of consecutive video frames in order to perform motion compensation and thus predict block pixel values and reduce transmission bandwidth. In order to reduce the magnitude of the transmitted Motion Vector (MV) and thus reduce bandwidth, the encoder utilizes Predicted Motion Vector (PMV), which is derived by taking the median vector of the corresponding MVs of the neighboring blocks. In this research, we propose innovative methods, based on neural networks prediction, for improving the accuracy of the calculated PMV. We begin by showing a straightforward approach of calculating the best matching PMV and signaling its neighbor block index value to the decoder while reducing the number of bits required to represent the result without adding any computation complexity. Then we use a classification Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) to estimate from neighbors the PMV without requiring signaling and show the advantage of the approach when employed for high motion movies. We demonstrate the advantages using fast forward movies. However, the same improvements apply to camera streams of autonomous vehicles, drone cameras, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, and similar applications whereas the MVs magnitudes are expected to be large. We also introduce a regression FCNN to predict the PMV. We calculate Huffman coded streams and demonstrate an order of ~34% reduction in number of bits required to transmit the best matching calculated PMV without reducing the quality, for fast forward movies with high motion. | Improvements of Motion Estimation and Coding using Neural Networks                                                                     |\n| Proton-proton collision data recorded in 2011 and 2012 by the \\lhcb experiment, co\\-rres\\-pon\\-ding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0\\invfb, are a\\-na\\-lysed to search for the charmless ${B^0 \\to \\rho^0 \\rho^0}$ decay.

We point out that the branch of the PBH family that disappeared - PBHs lighter than $\\sim 10^9$g that ostensibly Hawking evaporated away in the early Universe - also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics, for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs. We compute the strength of such GWs compatible with the observed DM relic density, and find that the GW signal morphology can in principle allow one to distinguish between the two PBH formation histories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The Primordial Black Holes that Disappeared: Connections to Dark Matter   and MHz-GHz Gravitational Waves                              |\n| I comment on Zaccone, Phys.

Radial localization of zonal flows is correlated with a region of zero magnetic shear and low-order (7/5) rational surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Strong ExB shear flows in the pedestal region in H-mode plasma                                                                         |\n| We consider string theory on the Lorentzian Melvin geometry, which is obtained by analytically continuing the two-parameter Euclidean Melvin background. Because this model provides a solvable conformal field theory that describes time-dependent twisted string dynamics, we study the string one-loop partition function and the D-brane spectrum.

They predicted that, besides bound stars that still belong to the star cluster, and unbound ones already stripped off, there is an intermediate population of stars that having acquired the enough energy to escape the cluster are still within the cluster Jacobi radius. Both, potential escapers and unbound stars, show hot kinematics, not observed along tidal tails of star clusters. We report on the first evidence of an open cluster with stars crossing such a transitional scenario, namely: ASCC 92. The open cluster gathers nearly 10 percent of its initial total mass, and is moving toward Galactic regions affected by higher interstellar absorption. Precisely, the obscured appearance of the cluster could have hampered disentangling its true internal dynamical evolutionary stage, previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Catching a Milky Way open cluster in its last breath                                                                                   |\n| Many machine learning applications are based on data collected from people, such as their tastes and behaviour as well as biological traits and genetic data. Regardless of how important the application might be, one has to make sure individuals' identities or the privacy of the data are not compromised in the analysis. Differential privacy constitutes a powerful framework that prevents breaching of data subject privacy from the output of a computation. Differentially private versions of many important Bayesian inference methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of an efficient unified approach applicable to arbitrary models. In this contribution, we propose a differentially private variational inference method with a very wide applicability. It is built on top of doubly stochastic variational inference, a recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of models. We add differential privacy into doubly stochastic variational inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the method can reach an accuracy close to non-private level under reasonably strong privacy guarantees, clearly improving over previous sampling-based alternatives especially in the strong privacy regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Differentially Private Variational Inference for Non-conjugate Models                                                                  |\n| Extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) is the task of selecting a small subset of relevant labels from a very large set of possible labels. As such, it is characterized by long-tail labels, i.e., most labels have very few positive instances. With standard performance measures such as precision@k, a classifier can ignore tail labels and still report good performance. However, it is often argued that correct predictions in the tail are more \"interesting\" or \"rewarding,\" but the community has not yet settled on a metric capturing this intuitive concept. The existing propensity-scored metrics fall short on this goal by confounding the problems of long-tail and missing labels. In this paper, we analyze generalized metrics budgeted \"at k\" as an alternative solution. To tackle the challenging problem of optimizing these metrics, we formulate it in the expected test utility (ETU) framework, which aims to optimize the expected performance on a fixed test set. We derive optimal prediction rules and construct computationally efficient approximations with provable regret guarantees and robustness against model misspecification. Our algorithm, based on block coordinate ascent, scales effortlessly to XMLC problems and obtains promising results in terms of long-tail performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Generalized test utilities for long-tail performance in extreme   multi-label classification                                           |\n| Altmetrics have led to new quantitative studies of science through social media interactions.

The energy of this hyperfine splitting is identified as the order parameter of the ferromagnetic phase transition. By measuring the temperature dependence of the energy we determined the critical exponent $\\beta = 0.350 \\pm 0.002$ and the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of $T_{\\text{C}} = 1400$~K. The present result of the critical exponent agrees better with the predicted value (0.367) of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg model than that determined previously by NMR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Hyperfine interaction in cobalt by high-resolution neutron spectroscopy                                                                |\n| We adapt Takahashi's modified spin-wave theory to the context of nano-magnets, and apply it to the molecular compound based on the giant magnetic molecule Mo(72)Fe(30). This involves solving numerically the mean-field equations and then forcing the sublattice magnetizations to zero by means of local chemical potentials for the magnons. We have thus constructed a quantum state with no local magnetization at all temperatures, appropriate to a finite-size system, but with strong correlations. We compare theoretical results to specific heat and ESR measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Modified Spin-Wave Theory for Nanomagnets : Application to the Keplerate   Molecule Mo(72)Fe(30)                                       |\n| In this paper, we study the disentanglement of speaker and language representations in non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS models from various aspects. We propose a phoneme length regulator that solves the length mismatch problem between IPA input sequence and monolingual alignment results. Using the phoneme length regulator, we present a FastPitch-based cross-lingual model with IPA symbols as input representations. Our experiments show that language-independent input representations (e.g. IPA symbols), an increasing number of training speakers, and explicit modeling of speech variance information all encourage non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS model to disentangle speaker and language representations. The subjective evaluation shows that our proposed model can achieve decent naturalness and speaker similarity in cross-language voice cloning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Exploring Timbre Disentanglement in Non-Autoregressive Cross-Lingual   Text-to-Speech                                                  |\n| Quantum electrodynamics (qed) is used to derive the differential cross sections measured in the three new experimental internal source ensemble x-ray holographies: bremsstrahlung (BXH), fluorescence (XFH), and multiple-energy (MEXH) x-ray holography. The polarization dependence of the BXH cross section is also obtained. For BXH, we study analytically and numerically the possible effects of the virtual photons and electrons which enter qed calculations in summing over the intermediate states. For the low photon and electron energies used in the current experiments, we show that the virtual intermediate states produce only very small effects. This is because the uncertainty principle limits the distance that the virtual particles can propagate to be much shorter than the separation between the regions of high electron density in the adjacent atoms. We also find that using the asymptotic form of the scattering wave function causes about a 5-10% error for near forward scattering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Quantum Electrodynamics of Internal Source X-Ray Holographies:   Bremsstrahlung, Fluorescence, and Multiple Energy X-Ray Holography    |\n| Determinations of the main cosmological parameters are reviewed and the implications for cold dark matter discussed.

Large scale structure and CMB fluctuation data are best fitted by a mixed dark matter $\\Omega_o$ = 1 universe.

This effect becomes particularly important when the Fermi level is close to a van Hove singularity. By performing {\\it ab initio} calculations on doped graphene we demonstrate that, while the apparent strength obtained from the slopes of experimental photoemission data is highly anisotropic, the angular dependence of the actual electron-phonon coupling strength in this material is negligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Van Hove Singularity and Apparent Anisotropy in the Electron-Phonon   Interaction in Graphene                                          |\n| For a single free scalar field in $d \\geq 2$ dimensions, almost all the unitary conformal defects must be `trivial' in the sense that they cannot hold interesting dynamics.

At the core of CORDIET is the C-K theory which captures the essential elements of innovation. The tool uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Emergent Self Organizing Maps (ESOM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) as main artifacts in the analysis process. The user can define temporal, text mining and compound attributes. The text mining attributes are used to analyze the unstructured text in documents, the temporal attributes use these document's timestamps for analysis. The compound attributes are XML rules based on text mining and temporal attributes. The user can cluster objects with object-cluster rules and can chop the data in pieces with segmentation rules. The artifacts are optimized for efficient data analysis; object labels in the FCA lattice and ESOM map contain an URL on which the user can click to open the selected document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Concept Relation Discovery and Innovation Enabling Technology (CORDIET)                                                                |\n| We study the Josephson current, I_J, in a junction consisting of two s-wave superconductors that are separated by a ferromagnetic barrier possessing a magnetic and non-magnetic scattering potential, g and Z, respectively.

Moreover, we compute the critical current, I_c for given g and Z, and show that it possesses two lines of non-analyticity in the (g, Z)-plane. We identify those regions in the (g, Z)-plane where the Josephson current changes sign with increasing temperature without a change in the relative phase between the two superconductors, i.e., without a transition between a 0 and \\pi state of the junction. Finally, we show that by changing the relative phase \\phi, it is possible to tune the junction through a first-order quantum phase transition in which the spin polarization of the two superconductors' combined ground state changes from &lt; S_z &gt; =0 to &lt; S_z &gt; =1/2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Charge Transport and Quantum Phase Transitions in Singlet Superconductor   - Ferromagnet - Singlet Superconductor Junctions            |\n| Inferring causal structures from time series data is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. A major barrier to such inference is the problem of subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurement is much lower than that of causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been proposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve identifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without any parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling arises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile, every hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at some observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure. Based on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the hidden variables and hence achieve identifiability. Following this intuition, we propose a proxy-based causal discovery algorithm. Our algorithm is nonparametric and can achieve full causal identification. Theoretical advantages are reflected in synthetic and real-world experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Causal Discovery from Subsampled Time Series with Proxy Variables                                                                      |\n| In the framework of Lindblad theory for open quantum systems, we calculate the entropy of a damped quantum harmonic oscillator which is initially in a quasi-free state. The maximally predictable states are identified as those states producing the minimum entropy increase after a long enough time. In general, the states with a squeezing parameter depending on the environment's diffusion coefficients and friction constant are singled out, but if the friction constant is much smaller than the oscillator's frequency, coherent states   (or thermalized coherent states) are obtained as the preferred classical states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Selection of Squeezed States via Decoherence                                                                                           |\n| Multimodal neuroimaging studies of corticobasal syndrome using volumetric MRI and DTI successfully discriminate between Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration but this evidence has typically included clinically heterogeneous patient cohorts and has rarely assessed the network structure of these distinct sources of pathology. Using structural MRI data, we identify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter density in corticobasal syndrome relative to age matched controls. A support vector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly discriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease pathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory power, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the underlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more accurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results highlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic analyses of corticobasal syndrome and suggest that distinct sources of pathology mediate the circuitry of brain regions affected by corticobasal syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Brain network efficiency is influenced by pathological source of   corticobasal syndrome                                               |\n| We study the problem of retrieving data from a channel that breaks the input sequence into a set of unordered fragments of random lengths, which we refer to as the chop-and-shuffle channel. The length of each fragment follows a geometric distribution. We propose nested Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes to recover the data. We evaluate the error rate and the complexity of our scheme numerically. Our results show that the decoding error decreases as the input length increases, and our method has a significantly lower complexity than the baseline brute-force approach. We also propose a new construction for VT codes, quantify the maximum number of the required parity bits, and show that our approach requires fewer parity bits compared to known results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Reassembly Codes for the Chop-and-Shuffle Channel                                                                                      |\n| The reliability of software that has a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a component is urgently important today given the increasing number of critical applications being deployed with DNNs. The need for reliability raises a need for rigorous testing of the safety and trustworthiness of these systems. In the last few years, there have been a number of research efforts focused on testing DNNs. However the test generation techniques proposed so far lack a check to determine whether the test inputs they are generating are valid, and thus invalid inputs are produced. To illustrate this situation, we explored three recent DNN testing techniques. Using deep generative model based input validation, we show that all the three techniques generate significant number of invalid test inputs. We further analyzed the test coverage achieved by the test inputs generated by the DNN testing techniques and showed how invalid test inputs can falsely inflate test coverage metrics.   To overcome the inclusion of invalid inputs in testing, we propose a technique to incorporate the valid input space of the DNN model under test in the test generation process. Our technique uses a deep generative model-based algorithm to generate only valid inputs. Results of our empirical studies show that our technique is effective in eliminating invalid tests and boosting the number of valid test inputs generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Distribution-Aware Testing of Neural Networks Using Generative Models                                                                  |\n| We follow the evolution of compact binaries under the coupled effect of tides and stellar winds until the onset of Roche-lobe overflow. These binaries contain a compact object (either a black-hole, a neutron-star, or a planet) and a stellar component. We integrate the full set of tidal equations, which are based on Hut's model for tidal evolution, and we couple them with the angular momentum loss in a stellar wind. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we wish to highlight some interesting evolutionary outcomes of the coupling. When tides are coupled with a non-massive stellar wind, one interesting outcome is that in certain types of binaries, the stellar spin tends to reach a quasi-equilibrium state, where the effect of tides and wind are counteracting each other. When tides are coupled with a massive wind, we parametrize the evolution in terms of the decoupling radius, at which the wind decouples from the star. Even for small decoupling radii this \\emph{wind braking} can drive systems on the main sequence to Roche-lobe overflow that otherwise would fail to do so. Our second aim is to inspect whether simple timescale considerations are a good description of the evolution of the systems. We find that simple timescale considerations, which rely on neglecting the coupling between tides and stellar winds, do not accurately represent the true evolution of compact binaries. The outcome of the coupled evolution of the rotational and orbital elements can strongly differ from simple timescale considerations, as already pointed out by Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2009 in the case of short-period planetary systems.                                                        | The coupled effect of tides and stellar winds on the evolution of   compact binaries                                                   |\n| Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for representing the topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both the models and the algorithm that learns them. By taking advantage of such information, learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate better solutions and require fewer iterations, while being robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental results, obtained from both simulated and real robot data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Learning Geometrically-Constrained Hidden Markov Models for Robot   Navigation: Bridging the Topological-Geometrical Gap               |\n| ⋮ | ⋮ |\n| Potential energy surfaces are calculated by using the most advanced asymmetric two-center shell model allowing to obtain shell and pairing corrections which are added to the Yukawa-plus-exponential model deformation energy.

We make the observation that the requirement is usually to transmit application layer objects (web pages, images, video frames etc) with low latency, and so it is the object delay rather than the per packet delay which is important. This has fundamental implications for multipath scheduler design. We introduce SOS (Stochastic Object-aware Scheduler), the first multipath scheduler that considers application layer object sizes and their relationship to link uncertainty. We demonstrate that SOS reduces the 95% percentile object delivery delay by 50-100% over production WiFi and LTE links compared to state-of-the art schedulers. We extend SOS to utilize FEC and to handle the scheduling multiple objects in parallel. We show that judicious priority scheduling of HTTP objects can lead to a 2-3x improvement in page load times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Low Delay Scheduling of Objects Over Multiple Wireless Paths                                                |\n| (Abr.) Laser guide stars employed at astronomical observatories provide artificial wavefront reference sources to help correct (in part) the impact of atmospheric turbulence on astrophysical observations. Following the recent commissioning of the 4 Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) on UT4 at the VLT, we characterize the spectral signature of the uplink beams from the 22W lasers to assess the impact of laser scattering from the 4LGSF on science observations. We use the MUSE optical integral field spectrograph to acquire spectra at a resolution of R~3000 of the uplink laser beams over the wavelength range of 4750\\AA\\ to 9350\\AA. We report the first detection of laser-induced Raman scattering by N2, O2, CO2, H2O and (tentatively) CH4 molecules in the atmosphere above the astronomical observatory of Cerro Paranal. In particular, our observations reveal the characteristic spectral signature of laser photons -- but 480\\AA\\ to 2210\\AA\\ redder than the original laser wavelength of 5889.959\\AA\\ -- landing on the 8.2m primary mirror of UT4 after being Raman-scattered on their way up to the sodium layer. Laser-induced Raman scattering is not unique to the observatory of Cerro Paranal, but common to any astronomical telescope employing a laser-guide-star (LGS) system. It is thus essential for any optical spectrograph coupled to a LGS system to handle thoroughly the possibility of a Raman spectral contamination via a proper baffling of the instrument and suitable calibrations procedures. These considerations are particularly applicable for the HARMONI optical spectrograph on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope. At sites hosting multiple telescopes, laser collision prediction tools also ought to account for the presence of Raman emission from the uplink laser beam(s) to avoid the unintentional contamination of observations acquired with telescopes in the vicinity of a LGS system. | Detection and Implications of Laser-Induced Raman Scattering at   Astronomical Observatories                |\n| The speed of sound is a novel probe of equation of state and phase transitions in dense cores of neutron stars. Recently nuclear experiments extracted a surprising thick neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb, causing tensions to reproduce the tidal deformability in gravitational-wave observations. This work finds that exotic structures in the speed of sound with a small softening slope followed by a steep-rising peak are required to reconcile the thick neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb with astronomical observations of neutron stars. Furthermore, the peak of speed of sound is narrowly constrained around two times the nuclear saturation density with the thick neutron skin. Consequently early and strong first-order phase transitions are comparatively more favorable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Speed of Sound and Phase Transitions in Neutron Stars Indicated by the   Thick Neutron Skin of $^{208}$Pb   |\n| Biomarker detection is the key to identifying health risks. However, designing sensitive biosensors in a single-use mode for disease diagnosis remains a major challenge. Here, we report sub-monolayer biolasers with remarkable repeatability for ultrasensitive and disposable biomarker detection. The biolaser sensors are designed by employing the telecom optical fibers as distributed optical microcavities and pushing the gain molecules down to the sub-monolayer level. We observe a status transition from the monolayer biolaser to the sub-monolayer biolaser by tuning the specific conjugation. By reducing the fluorophores down to the threshold density (~ 3.2 x 10-13 mol/cm2), we demonstrate an ultimate sensitivity of sub-monolayer biolaser with six orders of magnitude enhancement compared with the monolayer biolasers. We further achieved ultrasensitive immunoassay for Parkinson's disease biomarker, alpha-synuclein, with a lower limit of detection of 0.32 pM in serum. This biosensor with massive fabrication capability at ultralow cost provides a general method for the ultrasensitive disposable biodetection of disease biomarkers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sub-monolayer Biolasers: Lower Gain, Higher Sensitivity                                                     |\n| Graphene is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moir\\'e superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway towards controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials eliminating need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Photonic crystals for nano-light in moir\\'e graphene superlattices                                         |\n| Testing the order of accuracy of (very) high order methods for shallow water (and Euler) equations is a delicate operation and the test cases are the crucial starting point of this operation.

The proposed BGCS-CIM scheme considers effective cluster power gain and spatial diversity gain obtained by the additional paths within the indexed cluster to construct an efficient codebook. We also integrate the proposed scheme into a practical system model to create a virtual path between transmitter and receiver where the direct link has been blocked. Thanks to the designed whitening filter, a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error rate (ABER) is derived and used to validate the simulation results. It has been shown that the proposed BGCS-CIM scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks thanks to its higher effective cluster gain, spatial diversity of indexed clusters, and lower inter-cluster interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Cluster Index Modulation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted   mmWave Massive MIMO              |\n| We derive an exact formula for the covariance of cartesian distances in two simple polymer models, the freely-jointed chain and a discrete flexible model with nearest-neighbor interaction.

In particular we give the first provably robust algorithm for learning mixtures of any constant number of Gaussians. We require only mild assumptions on the mixing weights (bounded fractionality) and that the total variation distance between components is bounded away from zero. At the heart of our algorithm is a new method for proving dimension-independent polynomial identifiability through applying a carefully chosen sequence of differential operations to certain generating functions that not only encode the parameters we would like to learn but also the system of polynomial equations we would like to solve. We show how the symbolic identities we derive can be directly used to analyze a natural sum-of-squares relaxation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Settling the Robust Learnability of Mixtures of Gaussians                                                   |\n| We have detected [C I] 3P1-3P0 emissions in the gaseous debris disks of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris with the 10 m telescope of the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment, which is the first detection of such emissions. The line profiles of [C I] are found to resemble those of CO(J=3-2) observed with the same telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This result suggests that atomic carbon (C) coexists with CO in the debris disks, and is likely formed by the photodissociation of CO. Assuming an optically thin [C I] emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100 K, the column density of C is evaluated to be (2.2+-0.2)x10^17 and (2.5+-0.7)x10^16 cm^-2 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. The C/CO column density ratio is thus derived to be 54+-19 and 69+-42 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. These ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and diffuse clouds by an order of magnitude. The unusually high ratios of C to CO are likely attributed to a lack of H2 molecules needed to reproduce CO molecules efficiently from C. This result implies a small number of H2 molecules in the gas disk; i.e., there is an appreciable contribution of secondary gas from dust grains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Detection of submillimeter-wave [C I] emission in gaseous debris disks   of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris       |\n| We consider an involutive automorphism of the conformal algebra and the resulting symmetric space.

Vast undersampling errors occur by this method when intermittency is not taken into account. Oceanic turbulence increases intermittency as the result of a self-similar nonlinear cascade covering a wide range of scales, mostly horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for Galactic and oceanic turbulence are in the range 3-7. These values are consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of Kolmogorov (1962) and a length scale range over 3-7 decades from viscous or diffusive to buoyancy or Coriolis force domination, where the measured universal intermittency constant m_u = 0.44, Gibson (1991a), is a result of singularities in multifractal turbulence dissipation networks and their degeneration, Bershadskii and Gibson (1994). Nonlinear cascades of gravitational structure formation produce intermittent lognormal number densities of cosmological objects for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Intermittency of internal wave shear and turbulence dissipation                                             |\n| It is shown that the qualitative model of the high-temperature superconductivity suggested earlier for cuprates and doped picene and based on the idea that the valence electron state depends on the character of the chemical bonds they form and on the Coulomb interaction between the electrons is not only confirmed by the experimental data on iron pnictides but is also improved. From the chemical point of view, the high-temperature superconductivity is associated with additional $\\pi$ bonding along chains of covalently bonded ions via a delocalized $\\pi$ orbital, just like in cuprates. From the physical point of view, as the data on iron pnictides show, the superconductivity is associated with a FeAs layer transition into the state similar to a macroscopic quantum system characterized by a highly correlated electron state, formation of two-dimensional crystals of electron pairs with quantized energy levels, and a strong Coulomb interaction between these crystals. Superconductivity in such a system is accomplished by a two-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional Wigner crystals formed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same quasi-one-dimensional state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to a delocalized $\\pi$ orbital in chemistry. The model applicability to three different classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides) indicates that it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity taking into consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and strong Coulomb interactions between the electrons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Highly Correlated Electron State and High-Temperature Superconductivity   in Iron Pnictides                 |\n| It is a short report for the ICCM2019 Proceedings on recent results obtained with Michael Groechenig and Moritz Kerz concerning special subloci of the Betti moduli space of irreducible complex local systems on complex varieties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Survey on special subloci of the moduli spaces of local systems on   complex varieties                      |\n| The presence of stratified layer in atmosphere and ocean leads to buoyant vertical motions, commonly referred to as plumes. It is important to study the mixing dynamics of a plume at a local scale in order to model their evolution and growth. Such a characterization requires measuring the velocity and density of the mixing fluids simultaneously. Here, we present the results of a buoyant plume propagating in a linearly stratified medium with a density difference of 0.5%, thus yielding a buoyancy frequency of N=0.15 s^{-1}. To understand the plume behaviour, statistics such as centerline and axial velocities along varying downstream locations, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and buoyancy flux were measured. The centerline velocity was found to decrease with increase in height. The Reynolds stress and buoyancy flux profiles showed the presence of a unstable layer and the mixing associated within that layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Dynamics of a buoyant plume in a linearly stratified environment using   simultaneous PIV-PLIF measurements |\n| Using a near-field microwave technique, two-dimensional images have been made of the second and third order intermodulation distortion (IMD) of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 and YBa2Cu3O7 thin film microwave resonators. It was found that second and third order IMD do not have identical spatial distributions, which indicates that physical mechanisms play different roles in their generation. This technique enables the investigation of the roles of these mechanisms. As an illustration, the sensitivity to magnetic fluxons of the two orders is described, with second order being more sensitive to fluxon density.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Local Whole-Device Scanning of Distortion in Superconducting Microwave   Resonators                         |\n| Polyimide-based materials, like Kapton, are widely used in flexible cables and circuitry due to their unique electrical and mechanical characteristics. This study is aimed at investigating the radiopurity of Kapton for use in ultralow background, rare-event physics applications by measuring the $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th, and $^{nat}$K levels using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Commercial-off-the-shelf Kapton varieties, measured at approximately 950 and 120 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (1.2$\\times$10$^4$ and 490 $\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively, can be a significant background source for many current and next-generation ultralow background detectors. This study has found that the dominant contamination is due to the use of dicalcium phosphate (DCP), a nonessential slip additive added during manufacturing. Alternative Kapton materials were obtained that did not contain DCP and were determined to be significantly more radiopure than the commercially-available options with 12 and 19 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (150 and 77 $\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively. The lowest radioactivity version produced (Kapton ELJ, which contains an adhesive) was found to contain single digit pg/g levels of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, two-to-three orders of magnitude cleaner than commercial-off-the-shelf options. Moreover, copper-clad polyimide laminates employing Kapton ELJ as the insulator were obtained and shown to be very radiopure at 8.6 and 22 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (110 and 89 $\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Ultra-low radioactivity Kapton and copper-Kapton laminates                                                  |\n| We study behavior of J/psi in hot gluonic matter using   QCD sum rules.

The spin-parity effect is among the fundamental predictions that have yet to be clearly observed. It is predicted that quantum tunneling is suppressed at zero transverse field if the total spin of the magnetic system is half-integer (Kramers degeneracy) but is allowed in integer spin systems. The Landau-Zener method is used to measure the tunnel splitting as a function of transverse field. Spin-parity dependent tunneling is established by comparing the transverse field dependence of the tunnel splitting of integer and half-integer spin systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Spin-parity dependent tunneling of magnetization in single-molecule   magnets                               |\n| Anisotropy data analysis leaves a significant degeneracy between primeval spectral index (n_s) and cosmic opacity to CMB photons (\\tau). Low--l polarization measures, in principle, can remove it. We perform a likelihood analysis to see how cosmic variance possibly affects such a problem. We find that, for a sufficiently low noise level (\\sigma_{pix}) and if \\tau is not negligibly low, the degeneracy is greatly reduced, while the residual impact of cosmic variance on n_s and \\tau determinations is under control. On the contrary, if \\sigma_{pix} is too high, cosmic variance effects appear to be magnified. We apply general results to specific experiments and find that, if favorable conditions occur, it is possible that a 2--\\sigma detection of a lower limit on \\tau is provided by the SPOrt experiment. Furthermore, if the PLANCK experiment will measure polarization with the expected precision, the error on low--l harmonics is adequate to determine \\tau, without significant magnification of the cosmic variance. This however indicates that high sensitivity might be more important than high resolution in \\tau determinations. We also outline that a determination of \\tau is critical to perform detailed analyses on the nature of dark energy and/or on the presence of primeval gravitational waves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Cosmic opacity to CMB photons and polarization measurements                                                 |\n| We discuss Bose-Einstein condensation in a trapped gas of bosonic particles interacting dominantly via dipole-dipole forces.

Their emission is powered by some energy dissipation and particle acceleration mechanism operating in-situ at large distances from the black hole. We propose that the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by the time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic field lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may have their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized by an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it is a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form between the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers further jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of stripe widths $l&gt;l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find that the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the stripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks at a distance $z_{\\rm peak}\\sim 10^6 R_g\\, (\\Gamma_\\infty/30)^2\\, (l_{\\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where $R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ the jet's asymptotic Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by $\\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in distance. The prolonged energy dissipation accounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength spectra commonly observed in jets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of blazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to ~100 pc scales.

The vertices are replaced by unity while each propagator becomes a dual superconformal `R-invariant' whose arguments may be read off from the diagram. The momentum twistor MHV rules generate a formula for the full, all-loop planar integrand of the super Yang-Mills S-matrix that is manifestly dual superconformally invariant up to the choice of a reference twistor. We give a general proof of this reformulation and illustrate its use by computing the momentum twistor NMHV and NNMHV tree amplitudes and the integrands of the MHV and NMHV 1-loop and the MHV 2-loop planar amplitudes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | MHV Diagrams in Momentum Twistor Space                                                                      |\n| Solar flares are regularly detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite, however no gamma-ray emission from other stellar eruptions has ever been captured. The Swift detection in April 2014 of a powerful outburst originating from DG CVn, with associated optical and radio emissions, enticed us to search for possible 0.1-100 GeV emission from this flaring nearby binary star using the Fermi/LAT. No gamma-ray emission is detected from DG CVn in 2014, but we report a significant gamma-ray excess in November 2012, at a position consistent with that of the binary. There are no reports of contemporary flaring at other wavelengths from DG CVn or any other source within the error circle of the gamma-ray source. We argue that the gamma-ray flare is more likely to have been associated with a background blazar than with DG CVn and identify a candidate for follow-up study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Fermi/LAT detection of a transient gamma-ray flare in the vicinity of   the binary star DG CVn              |\n| Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system monitored by a network of sensors, modeled as nodes of an underlying directed communication graph. We study the problem of collaboratively estimating the state of the system when certain nodes are compromised by adversaries. Specifically, we consider a Byzantine adversary model, where a compromised node possesses complete knowledge of the system dynamics and the network, and can deviate arbitrarily from the rules of any prescribed algorithm. We first characterize certain fundamental limitations of any distributed state estimation algorithm in terms of the measurement and communication structure of the nodes. We then develop an attack-resilient, provably correct state estimation algorithm that admits a fully distributed implementation. To characterize feasible network topologies that guarantee success of our proposed technique, we introduce a notion of `strong-robustness' that captures both measurement and communication redundancy. Finally, by drawing connections to bootstrap percolation theory, we argue that given an LTI system and an associated sensor network, the `strong-robustness' property can be checked in polynomial time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Observers for LTI Systems                                                   |\n\n",

It leverages correlation between blocks of consecutive video frames in order to perform motion compensation and thus predict block pixel values and reduce transmission bandwidth. In order to reduce the magnitude of the transmitted Motion Vector (MV) and thus reduce bandwidth, the encoder utilizes Predicted Motion Vector (PMV), which is derived by taking the median vector of the corresponding MVs of the neighboring blocks. In this research, we propose innovative methods, based on neural networks prediction, for improving the accuracy of the calculated PMV. We begin by showing a straightforward approach of calculating the best matching PMV and signaling its neighbor block index value to the decoder while reducing the number of bits required to represent the result without adding any computation complexity. Then we use a classification Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) to estimate from neighbors the PMV without requiring signaling and show the advantage of the approach when employed for high motion movies. We demonstrate the advantages using fast forward movies. However, the same improvements apply to camera streams of autonomous vehicles, drone cameras, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, and similar applications whereas the MVs magnitudes are expected to be large. We also introduce a regression FCNN to predict the PMV. We calculate Huffman coded streams and demonstrate an order of \\textasciitilde{}34\\% reduction in number of bits required to transmit the best matching calculated PMV without reducing the quality, for fast forward movies with high motion. & Improvements of Motion Estimation and Coding using Neural Networks                                                                    \\\\\n\t Proton-proton collision data recorded in 2011 and 2012 by the \\textbackslash{}lhcb experiment, co\\textbackslash{}-rres\\textbackslash{}-pon\\textbackslash{}-ding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0\\textbackslash{}invfb, are a\\textbackslash{}-na\\textbackslash{}-lysed to search for the charmless \\$\\{B\\textasciicircum{}0 \\textbackslash{}to \\textbackslash{}rho\\textasciicircum{}0 \\textbackslash{}rho\\textasciicircum{}0\\}\\$ decay.

We point out that the branch of the PBH family that disappeared - PBHs lighter than \\$\\textbackslash{}sim 10\\textasciicircum{}9\\$g that ostensibly Hawking evaporated away in the early Universe - also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics, for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs. We compute the strength of such GWs compatible with the observed DM relic density, and find that the GW signal morphology can in principle allow one to distinguish between the two PBH formation histories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & The Primordial Black Holes that Disappeared: Connections to Dark Matter   and MHz-GHz Gravitational Waves                             \\\\\n\t I comment on Zaccone, Phys.

We found that both the wrapping D2-brane and the codimension-one D-string emit winding strings, and this behavior can be traced to the modified open string Hamiltonian on these probe D-branes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & D-branes in the Lorentzian Melvin Geometry                                                                                            \\\\\n\t We link the structure of nuclei around \\$\\textasciicircum{}\\{100\\}\\$Sn, the heaviest doubly magic nucleus with equal neutron and proton numbers (\\$N=Z=50\\$), to nucleon-nucleon (\\$NN\\$) and three-nucleon (\\$NNN\\$) forces constrained by data of few-nucleon systems.

They predicted that, besides bound stars that still belong to the star cluster, and unbound ones already stripped off, there is an intermediate population of stars that having acquired the enough energy to escape the cluster are still within the cluster Jacobi radius. Both, potential escapers and unbound stars, show hot kinematics, not observed along tidal tails of star clusters. We report on the first evidence of an open cluster with stars crossing such a transitional scenario, namely: ASCC 92. The open cluster gathers nearly 10 percent of its initial total mass, and is moving toward Galactic regions affected by higher interstellar absorption. Precisely, the obscured appearance of the cluster could have hampered disentangling its true internal dynamical evolutionary stage, previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & Catching a Milky Way open cluster in its last breath                                                                                  \\\\\n\t Many machine learning applications are based on data collected from people, such as their tastes and behaviour as well as biological traits and genetic data. Regardless of how important the application might be, one has to make sure individuals' identities or the privacy of the data are not compromised in the analysis. Differential privacy constitutes a powerful framework that prevents breaching of data subject privacy from the output of a computation. Differentially private versions of many important Bayesian inference methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of an efficient unified approach applicable to arbitrary models. In this contribution, we propose a differentially private variational inference method with a very wide applicability. It is built on top of doubly stochastic variational inference, a recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of models. We add differential privacy into doubly stochastic variational inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the method can reach an accuracy close to non-private level under reasonably strong privacy guarantees, clearly improving over previous sampling-based alternatives especially in the strong privacy regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & Differentially Private Variational Inference for Non-conjugate Models                                                                 \\\\\n\t Extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) is the task of selecting a small subset of relevant labels from a very large set of possible labels. As such, it is characterized by long-tail labels, i.e., most labels have very few positive instances. With standard performance measures such as precision@k, a classifier can ignore tail labels and still report good performance. However, it is often argued that correct predictions in the tail are more \"interesting\" or \"rewarding,\" but the community has not yet settled on a metric capturing this intuitive concept. The existing propensity-scored metrics fall short on this goal by confounding the problems of long-tail and missing labels. In this paper, we analyze generalized metrics budgeted \"at k\" as an alternative solution. To tackle the challenging problem of optimizing these metrics, we formulate it in the expected test utility (ETU) framework, which aims to optimize the expected performance on a fixed test set. We derive optimal prediction rules and construct computationally efficient approximations with provable regret guarantees and robustness against model misspecification. Our algorithm, based on block coordinate ascent, scales effortlessly to XMLC problems and obtains promising results in terms of long-tail performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & Generalized test utilities for long-tail performance in extreme   multi-label classification                                          \\\\\n\t Altmetrics have led to new quantitative studies of science through social media interactions.

The present result of the critical exponent agrees better with the predicted value (0.367) of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg model than that determined previously by NMR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Hyperfine interaction in cobalt by high-resolution neutron spectroscopy                                                               \\\\\n\t We adapt Takahashi's modified spin-wave theory to the context of nano-magnets, and apply it to the molecular compound based on the giant magnetic molecule Mo(72)Fe(30). This involves solving numerically the mean-field equations and then forcing the sublattice magnetizations to zero by means of local chemical potentials for the magnons. We have thus constructed a quantum state with no local magnetization at all temperatures, appropriate to a finite-size system, but with strong correlations. We compare theoretical results to specific heat and ESR measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Modified Spin-Wave Theory for Nanomagnets : Application to the Keplerate   Molecule Mo(72)Fe(30)                                      \\\\\n\t In this paper, we study the disentanglement of speaker and language representations in non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS models from various aspects. We propose a phoneme length regulator that solves the length mismatch problem between IPA input sequence and monolingual alignment results. Using the phoneme length regulator, we present a FastPitch-based cross-lingual model with IPA symbols as input representations. Our experiments show that language-independent input representations (e.g. IPA symbols), an increasing number of training speakers, and explicit modeling of speech variance information all encourage non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS model to disentangle speaker and language representations. The subjective evaluation shows that our proposed model can achieve decent naturalness and speaker similarity in cross-language voice cloning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & Exploring Timbre Disentanglement in Non-Autoregressive Cross-Lingual   Text-to-Speech                                                 \\\\\n\t Quantum electrodynamics (qed) is used to derive the differential cross sections measured in the three new experimental internal source ensemble x-ray holographies: bremsstrahlung (BXH), fluorescence (XFH), and multiple-energy (MEXH) x-ray holography. The polarization dependence of the BXH cross section is also obtained. For BXH, we study analytically and numerically the possible effects of the virtual photons and electrons which enter qed calculations in summing over the intermediate states. For the low photon and electron energies used in the current experiments, we show that the virtual intermediate states produce only very small effects. This is because the uncertainty principle limits the distance that the virtual particles can propagate to be much shorter than the separation between the regions of high electron density in the adjacent atoms. We also find that using the asymptotic form of the scattering wave function causes about a 5-10\\% error for near forward scattering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Quantum Electrodynamics of Internal Source X-Ray Holographies:   Bremsstrahlung, Fluorescence, and Multiple Energy X-Ray Holography   \\\\\n\t Determinations of the main cosmological parameters are reviewed and the implications for cold dark matter discussed.

This effect becomes particularly important when the Fermi level is close to a van Hove singularity.

At the core of CORDIET is the C-K theory which captures the essential elements of innovation. The tool uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Emergent Self Organizing Maps (ESOM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) as main artifacts in the analysis process. The user can define temporal, text mining and compound attributes. The text mining attributes are used to analyze the unstructured text in documents, the temporal attributes use these document's timestamps for analysis. The compound attributes are XML rules based on text mining and temporal attributes. The user can cluster objects with object-cluster rules and can chop the data in pieces with segmentation rules. The artifacts are optimized for efficient data analysis; object labels in the FCA lattice and ESOM map contain an URL on which the user can click to open the selected document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & Concept Relation Discovery and Innovation Enabling Technology (CORDIET)                                                               \\\\\n\t We study the Josephson current, I\\_J, in a junction consisting of two s-wave superconductors that are separated by a ferromagnetic barrier possessing a magnetic and non-magnetic scattering potential, g and Z, respectively.

A major barrier to such inference is the problem of subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurement is much lower than that of causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been proposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve identifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without any parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling arises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile, every hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at some observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure. Based on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the hidden variables and hence achieve identifiability. Following this intuition, we propose a proxy-based causal discovery algorithm. Our algorithm is nonparametric and can achieve full causal identification. Theoretical advantages are reflected in synthetic and real-world experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & Causal Discovery from Subsampled Time Series with Proxy Variables                                                                     \\\\\n\t In the framework of Lindblad theory for open quantum systems, we calculate the entropy of a damped quantum harmonic oscillator which is initially in a quasi-free state. The maximally predictable states are identified as those states producing the minimum entropy increase after a long enough time. In general, the states with a squeezing parameter depending on the environment's diffusion coefficients and friction constant are singled out, but if the friction constant is much smaller than the oscillator's frequency, coherent states   (or thermalized coherent states) are obtained as the preferred classical states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & Selection of Squeezed States via Decoherence                                                                                          \\\\\n\t Multimodal neuroimaging studies of corticobasal syndrome using volumetric MRI and DTI successfully discriminate between Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration but this evidence has typically included clinically heterogeneous patient cohorts and has rarely assessed the network structure of these distinct sources of pathology. Using structural MRI data, we identify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter density in corticobasal syndrome relative to age matched controls. A support vector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly discriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease pathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory power, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the underlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more accurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results highlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic analyses of corticobasal syndrome and suggest that distinct sources of pathology mediate the circuitry of brain regions affected by corticobasal syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & Brain network efficiency is influenced by pathological source of   corticobasal syndrome                                              \\\\\n\t We study the problem of retrieving data from a channel that breaks the input sequence into a set of unordered fragments of random lengths, which we refer to as the chop-and-shuffle channel. The length of each fragment follows a geometric distribution. We propose nested Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes to recover the data. We evaluate the error rate and the complexity of our scheme numerically. Our results show that the decoding error decreases as the input length increases, and our method has a significantly lower complexity than the baseline brute-force approach. We also propose a new construction for VT codes, quantify the maximum number of the required parity bits, and show that our approach requires fewer parity bits compared to known results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Reassembly Codes for the Chop-and-Shuffle Channel                                                                                     \\\\\n\t The reliability of software that has a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a component is urgently important today given the increasing number of critical applications being deployed with DNNs. The need for reliability raises a need for rigorous testing of the safety and trustworthiness of these systems. In the last few years, there have been a number of research efforts focused on testing DNNs. However the test generation techniques proposed so far lack a check to determine whether the test inputs they are generating are valid, and thus invalid inputs are produced. To illustrate this situation, we explored three recent DNN testing techniques. Using deep generative model based input validation, we show that all the three techniques generate significant number of invalid test inputs. We further analyzed the test coverage achieved by the test inputs generated by the DNN testing techniques and showed how invalid test inputs can falsely inflate test coverage metrics.   To overcome the inclusion of invalid inputs in testing, we propose a technique to incorporate the valid input space of the DNN model under test in the test generation process. Our technique uses a deep generative model-based algorithm to generate only valid inputs. Results of our empirical studies show that our technique is effective in eliminating invalid tests and boosting the number of valid test inputs generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Distribution-Aware Testing of Neural Networks Using Generative Models                                                                 \\\\\n\t We follow the evolution of compact binaries under the coupled effect of tides and stellar winds until the onset of Roche-lobe overflow. These binaries contain a compact object (either a black-hole, a neutron-star, or a planet) and a stellar component. We integrate the full set of tidal equations, which are based on Hut's model for tidal evolution, and we couple them with the angular momentum loss in a stellar wind. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we wish to highlight some interesting evolutionary outcomes of the coupling. When tides are coupled with a non-massive stellar wind, one interesting outcome is that in certain types of binaries, the stellar spin tends to reach a quasi-equilibrium state, where the effect of tides and wind are counteracting each other. When tides are coupled with a massive wind, we parametrize the evolution in terms of the decoupling radius, at which the wind decouples from the star. Even for small decoupling radii this \\textbackslash{}emph\\{wind braking\\} can drive systems on the main sequence to Roche-lobe overflow that otherwise would fail to do so. Our second aim is to inspect whether simple timescale considerations are a good description of the evolution of the systems. We find that simple timescale considerations, which rely on neglecting the coupling between tides and stellar winds, do not accurately represent the true evolution of compact binaries. The outcome of the coupled evolution of the rotational and orbital elements can strongly differ from simple timescale considerations, as already pointed out by Barker \\& Ogilvie 2009 in the case of short-period planetary systems.                                                        & The coupled effect of tides and stellar winds on the evolution of   compact binaries                                                  \\\\\n\t Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for representing the topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both the models and the algorithm that learns them. By taking advantage of such information, learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate better solutions and require fewer iterations, while being robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental results, obtained from both simulated and real robot data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & Learning Geometrically-Constrained Hidden Markov Models for Robot   Navigation: Bridging the Topological-Geometrical Gap              \\\\\n\t ⋮ & ⋮\\\\\n\t Potential energy surfaces are calculated by using the most advanced asymmetric two-center shell model allowing to obtain shell and pairing corrections which are added to the Yukawa-plus-exponential model deformation energy.

We make the observation that the requirement is usually to transmit application layer objects (web pages, images, video frames etc) with low latency, and so it is the object delay rather than the per packet delay which is important. This has fundamental implications for multipath scheduler design. We introduce SOS (Stochastic Object-aware Scheduler), the first multipath scheduler that considers application layer object sizes and their relationship to link uncertainty. We demonstrate that SOS reduces the 95\\% percentile object delivery delay by 50-100\\% over production WiFi and LTE links compared to state-of-the art schedulers. We extend SOS to utilize FEC and to handle the scheduling multiple objects in parallel. We show that judicious priority scheduling of HTTP objects can lead to a 2-3x improvement in page load times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & Low Delay Scheduling of Objects Over Multiple Wireless Paths                                               \\\\\n\t (Abr.) Laser guide stars employed at astronomical observatories provide artificial wavefront reference sources to help correct (in part) the impact of atmospheric turbulence on astrophysical observations. Following the recent commissioning of the 4 Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) on UT4 at the VLT, we characterize the spectral signature of the uplink beams from the 22W lasers to assess the impact of laser scattering from the 4LGSF on science observations. We use the MUSE optical integral field spectrograph to acquire spectra at a resolution of R\\textasciitilde{}3000 of the uplink laser beams over the wavelength range of 4750\\textbackslash{}AA\\textbackslash{} to 9350\\textbackslash{}AA. We report the first detection of laser-induced Raman scattering by N2, O2, CO2, H2O and (tentatively) CH4 molecules in the atmosphere above the astronomical observatory of Cerro Paranal. In particular, our observations reveal the characteristic spectral signature of laser photons -- but 480\\textbackslash{}AA\\textbackslash{} to 2210\\textbackslash{}AA\\textbackslash{} redder than the original laser wavelength of 5889.959\\textbackslash{}AA\\textbackslash{} -- landing on the 8.2m primary mirror of UT4 after being Raman-scattered on their way up to the sodium layer. Laser-induced Raman scattering is not unique to the observatory of Cerro Paranal, but common to any astronomical telescope employing a laser-guide-star (LGS) system. It is thus essential for any optical spectrograph coupled to a LGS system to handle thoroughly the possibility of a Raman spectral contamination via a proper baffling of the instrument and suitable calibrations procedures. These considerations are particularly applicable for the HARMONI optical spectrograph on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope. At sites hosting multiple telescopes, laser collision prediction tools also ought to account for the presence of Raman emission from the uplink laser beam(s) to avoid the unintentional contamination of observations acquired with telescopes in the vicinity of a LGS system. & Detection and Implications of Laser-Induced Raman Scattering at   Astronomical Observatories               \\\\\n\t The speed of sound is a novel probe of equation of state and phase transitions in dense cores of neutron stars.

However, designing sensitive biosensors in a single-use mode for disease diagnosis remains a major challenge. Here, we report sub-monolayer biolasers with remarkable repeatability for ultrasensitive and disposable biomarker detection. The biolaser sensors are designed by employing the telecom optical fibers as distributed optical microcavities and pushing the gain molecules down to the sub-monolayer level. We observe a status transition from the monolayer biolaser to the sub-monolayer biolaser by tuning the specific conjugation. By reducing the fluorophores down to the threshold density (\\textasciitilde{} 3.2 x 10-13 mol/cm2), we demonstrate an ultimate sensitivity of sub-monolayer biolaser with six orders of magnitude enhancement compared with the monolayer biolasers. We further achieved ultrasensitive immunoassay for Parkinson's disease biomarker, alpha-synuclein, with a lower limit of detection of 0.32 pM in serum. This biosensor with massive fabrication capability at ultralow cost provides a general method for the ultrasensitive disposable biodetection of disease biomarkers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & Sub-monolayer Biolasers: Lower Gain, Higher Sensitivity                                                    \\\\\n\t Graphene is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moir\\textbackslash{}'e superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway towards controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials eliminating need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Photonic crystals for nano-light in moir\\textbackslash{}'e graphene superlattices                                        \\\\\n\t Testing the order of accuracy of (very) high order methods for shallow water (and Euler) equations is a delicate operation and the test cases are the crucial starting point of this operation.

The proposed BGCS-CIM scheme considers effective cluster power gain and spatial diversity gain obtained by the additional paths within the indexed cluster to construct an efficient codebook. We also integrate the proposed scheme into a practical system model to create a virtual path between transmitter and receiver where the direct link has been blocked. Thanks to the designed whitening filter, a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error rate (ABER) is derived and used to validate the simulation results. It has been shown that the proposed BGCS-CIM scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks thanks to its higher effective cluster gain, spatial diversity of indexed clusters, and lower inter-cluster interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Cluster Index Modulation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted   mmWave Massive MIMO             \\\\\n\t We derive an exact formula for the covariance of cartesian distances in two simple polymer models, the freely-jointed chain and a discrete flexible model with nearest-neighbor interaction.

We require only mild assumptions on the mixing weights (bounded fractionality) and that the total variation distance between components is bounded away from zero. At the heart of our algorithm is a new method for proving dimension-independent polynomial identifiability through applying a carefully chosen sequence of differential operations to certain generating functions that not only encode the parameters we would like to learn but also the system of polynomial equations we would like to solve. We show how the symbolic identities we derive can be directly used to analyze a natural sum-of-squares relaxation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Settling the Robust Learnability of Mixtures of Gaussians                                                  \\\\\n\t We have detected {[}C I{]} 3P1-3P0 emissions in the gaseous debris disks of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris with the 10 m telescope of the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment, which is the first detection of such emissions. The line profiles of {[}C I{]} are found to resemble those of CO(J=3-2) observed with the same telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This result suggests that atomic carbon (C) coexists with CO in the debris disks, and is likely formed by the photodissociation of CO. Assuming an optically thin {[}C I{]} emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100 K, the column density of C is evaluated to be (2.2+-0.2)x10\\textasciicircum{}17 and (2.5+-0.7)x10\\textasciicircum{}16 cm\\textasciicircum{}-2 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. The C/CO column density ratio is thus derived to be 54+-19 and 69+-42 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. These ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and diffuse clouds by an order of magnitude. The unusually high ratios of C to CO are likely attributed to a lack of H2 molecules needed to reproduce CO molecules efficiently from C. This result implies a small number of H2 molecules in the gas disk; i.e., there is an appreciable contribution of secondary gas from dust grains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Detection of submillimeter-wave {[}C I{]} emission in gaseous debris disks   of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris      \\\\\n\t We consider an involutive automorphism of the conformal algebra and the resulting symmetric space.

Vast undersampling errors occur by this method when intermittency is not taken into account. Oceanic turbulence increases intermittency as the result of a self-similar nonlinear cascade covering a wide range of scales, mostly horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for Galactic and oceanic turbulence are in the range 3-7. These values are consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of Kolmogorov (1962) and a length scale range over 3-7 decades from viscous or diffusive to buoyancy or Coriolis force domination, where the measured universal intermittency constant m\\_u = 0.44, Gibson (1991a), is a result of singularities in multifractal turbulence dissipation networks and their degeneration, Bershadskii and Gibson (1994). Nonlinear cascades of gravitational structure formation produce intermittent lognormal number densities of cosmological objects for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Intermittency of internal wave shear and turbulence dissipation                                            \\\\\n\t It is shown that the qualitative model of the high-temperature superconductivity suggested earlier for cuprates and doped picene and based on the idea that the valence electron state depends on the character of the chemical bonds they form and on the Coulomb interaction between the electrons is not only confirmed by the experimental data on iron pnictides but is also improved. From the chemical point of view, the high-temperature superconductivity is associated with additional \\$\\textbackslash{}pi\\$ bonding along chains of covalently bonded ions via a delocalized \\$\\textbackslash{}pi\\$ orbital, just like in cuprates. From the physical point of view, as the data on iron pnictides show, the superconductivity is associated with a FeAs layer transition into the state similar to a macroscopic quantum system characterized by a highly correlated electron state, formation of two-dimensional crystals of electron pairs with quantized energy levels, and a strong Coulomb interaction between these crystals. Superconductivity in such a system is accomplished by a two-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional Wigner crystals formed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same quasi-one-dimensional state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to a delocalized \\$\\textbackslash{}pi\\$ orbital in chemistry. The model applicability to three different classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides) indicates that it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity taking into consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and strong Coulomb interactions between the electrons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & Highly Correlated Electron State and High-Temperature Superconductivity   in Iron Pnictides                \\\\\n\t It is a short report for the ICCM2019 Proceedings on recent results obtained with Michael Groechenig and Moritz Kerz concerning special subloci of the Betti moduli space of irreducible complex local systems on complex varieties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Survey on special subloci of the moduli spaces of local systems on   complex varieties                     \\\\\n\t The presence of stratified layer in atmosphere and ocean leads to buoyant vertical motions, commonly referred to as plumes. It is important to study the mixing dynamics of a plume at a local scale in order to model their evolution and growth. Such a characterization requires measuring the velocity and density of the mixing fluids simultaneously. Here, we present the results of a buoyant plume propagating in a linearly stratified medium with a density difference of 0.5\\%, thus yielding a buoyancy frequency of N=0.15 s\\textasciicircum{}\\{-1\\}. To understand the plume behaviour, statistics such as centerline and axial velocities along varying downstream locations, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and buoyancy flux were measured. The centerline velocity was found to decrease with increase in height. The Reynolds stress and buoyancy flux profiles showed the presence of a unstable layer and the mixing associated within that layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Dynamics of a buoyant plume in a linearly stratified environment using   simultaneous PIV-PLIF measurements\\\\\n\t Using a near-field microwave technique, two-dimensional images have been made of the second and third order intermodulation distortion (IMD) of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 and YBa2Cu3O7 thin film microwave resonators.

The spin-parity effect is among the fundamental predictions that have yet to be clearly observed. It is predicted that quantum tunneling is suppressed at zero transverse field if the total spin of the magnetic system is half-integer (Kramers degeneracy) but is allowed in integer spin systems. The Landau-Zener method is used to measure the tunnel splitting as a function of transverse field. Spin-parity dependent tunneling is established by comparing the transverse field dependence of the tunnel splitting of integer and half-integer spin systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & Spin-parity dependent tunneling of magnetization in single-molecule   magnets                              \\\\\n\t Anisotropy data analysis leaves a significant degeneracy between primeval spectral index (n\\_s) and cosmic opacity to CMB photons (\\textbackslash{}tau). Low--l polarization measures, in principle, can remove it. We perform a likelihood analysis to see how cosmic variance possibly affects such a problem. We find that, for a sufficiently low noise level (\\textbackslash{}sigma\\_\\{pix\\}) and if \\textbackslash{}tau is not negligibly low, the degeneracy is greatly reduced, while the residual impact of cosmic variance on n\\_s and \\textbackslash{}tau determinations is under control. On the contrary, if \\textbackslash{}sigma\\_\\{pix\\} is too high, cosmic variance effects appear to be magnified. We apply general results to specific experiments and find that, if favorable conditions occur, it is possible that a 2--\\textbackslash{}sigma detection of a lower limit on \\textbackslash{}tau is provided by the SPOrt experiment. Furthermore, if the PLANCK experiment will measure polarization with the expected precision, the error on low--l harmonics is adequate to determine \\textbackslash{}tau, without significant magnification of the cosmic variance. This however indicates that high sensitivity might be more important than high resolution in \\textbackslash{}tau determinations. We also outline that a determination of \\textbackslash{}tau is critical to perform detailed analyses on the nature of dark energy and/or on the presence of primeval gravitational waves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Cosmic opacity to CMB photons and polarization measurements                                                \\\\\n\t We discuss Bose-Einstein condensation in a trapped gas of bosonic particles interacting dominantly via dipole-dipole forces.

Their emission is powered by some energy dissipation and particle acceleration mechanism operating in-situ at large distances from the black hole. We propose that the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by the time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic field lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may have their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized by an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it is a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form between the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers further jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of stripe widths \\$l>l\\_\\{\\textbackslash{}rm min\\}\\$, above a dominant scale \\$l\\_\\{\\textbackslash{}rm min\\}\\$. We find that the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the stripes, is very gradual.

The prolonged energy dissipation accounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength spectra commonly observed in jets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of blazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to \\textasciitilde{}100 pc scales. In GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the photopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components.            & GRB and blazar jets shining through their stripes                                                          \\\\\n\t For a finite set \\$A \\textbackslash{}subseteq \\textbackslash{}mathbb\\{R\\}\\textasciicircum{}n\\$, consider a function \\$u \\textbackslash{}in \\textbackslash{}mathrm\\{BV\\}\\_\\{\\textbackslash{}mathrm\\{loc\\}\\}\\textasciicircum{}2(\\textbackslash{}mathbb\\{R\\}\\textasciicircum{}n)\\$ such that \\$\\textbackslash{}nabla u \\textbackslash{}in A\\$ almost everywhere.

The vertices are replaced by unity while each propagator becomes a dual superconformal `R-invariant' whose arguments may be read off from the diagram. The momentum twistor MHV rules generate a formula for the full, all-loop planar integrand of the super Yang-Mills S-matrix that is manifestly dual superconformally invariant up to the choice of a reference twistor. We give a general proof of this reformulation and illustrate its use by computing the momentum twistor NMHV and NNMHV tree amplitudes and the integrands of the MHV and NMHV 1-loop and the MHV 2-loop planar amplitudes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & MHV Diagrams in Momentum Twistor Space                                                                     \\\\\n\t Solar flares are regularly detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite, however no gamma-ray emission from other stellar eruptions has ever been captured. The Swift detection in April 2014 of a powerful outburst originating from DG CVn, with associated optical and radio emissions, enticed us to search for possible 0.1-100 GeV emission from this flaring nearby binary star using the Fermi/LAT. No gamma-ray emission is detected from DG CVn in 2014, but we report a significant gamma-ray excess in November 2012, at a position consistent with that of the binary. There are no reports of contemporary flaring at other wavelengths from DG CVn or any other source within the error circle of the gamma-ray source. We argue that the gamma-ray flare is more likely to have been associated with a background blazar than with DG CVn and identify a candidate for follow-up study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & Fermi/LAT detection of a transient gamma-ray flare in the vicinity of   the binary star DG CVn             \\\\\n\t Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system monitored by a network of sensors, modeled as nodes of an underlying directed communication graph. We study the problem of collaboratively estimating the state of the system when certain nodes are compromised by adversaries. Specifically, we consider a Byzantine adversary model, where a compromised node possesses complete knowledge of the system dynamics and the network, and can deviate arbitrarily from the rules of any prescribed algorithm. We first characterize certain fundamental limitations of any distributed state estimation algorithm in terms of the measurement and communication structure of the nodes. We then develop an attack-resilient, provably correct state estimation algorithm that admits a fully distributed implementation. To characterize feasible network topologies that guarantee success of our proposed technique, we introduce a notion of `strong-robustness' that captures both measurement and communication redundancy. Finally, by drawing connections to bootstrap percolation theory, we argue that given an LTI system and an associated sensor network, the `strong-robustness' property can be checked in polynomial time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Observers for LTI Systems                                                  \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n",

This phenomenon is demonstrated and explained by the example of the enlarged spectral problem of the Korteweg - de Vries equation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "2   The Open Science Collaboration recently reported that 36% of published findings from psychological studies were reproducible by independent researchers. We can use this information together with Bayes theorem to estimate the statistical power needed to produce these findings under various assumptions and calculate the expected distribution of positive and negative evidence for a range of prior probabilities of the tested hypotheses; and by comparing this distribution to other findings indicating that >90% of publications in the psychological literature are statistically significant in support of the authors hypothesis, we can estimate the magnitude of publication bias. The results indicate that negative evidence was observed 30--200 times before one was published.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "3   Inter-Prediction is used effectively in multiple standards, including H.264 and HEVC (also known as H.265). It leverages correlation between blocks of consecutive video frames in order to perform motion compensation and thus predict block pixel values and reduce transmission bandwidth. In order to reduce the magnitude of the transmitted Motion Vector (MV) and thus reduce bandwidth, the encoder utilizes Predicted Motion Vector (PMV), which is derived by taking the median vector of the corresponding MVs of the neighboring blocks. In this research, we propose innovative methods, based on neural networks prediction, for improving the accuracy of the calculated PMV. We begin by showing a straightforward approach of calculating the best matching PMV and signaling its neighbor block index value to the decoder while reducing the number of bits required to represent the result without adding any computation complexity. Then we use a classification Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) to estimate from neighbors the PMV without requiring signaling and show the advantage of the approach when employed for high motion movies. We demonstrate the advantages using fast forward movies. However, the same improvements apply to camera streams of autonomous vehicles, drone cameras, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, and similar applications whereas the MVs magnitudes are expected to be large. We also introduce a regression FCNN to predict the PMV. We calculate Huffman coded streams and demonstrate an order of ~34% reduction in number of bits required to transmit the best matching calculated PMV without reducing the quality, for fast forward movies with high motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

              "6   In the post-LIGO era, there has been a lot of focus on primordial black holes (PBHs) heavier than $\\\\sim 10^{15}$g as potential dark matter (DM) candidates. We point out that the branch of the PBH family that disappeared - PBHs lighter than $\\\\sim 10^9$g that ostensibly Hawking evaporated away in the early Universe - also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics, for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs. We compute the strength of such GWs compatible with the observed DM relic density, and find that the GW signal morphology can in principle allow one to distinguish between the two PBH formation histories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

              "8   We report the first experimental observation of stationary zonal flows in the pedestal region of the H-mode plasma in the H-1 toroidal heliac. Strong peaks in E_r shear mark the top and foot of the density pedestal. Strong m=n=0 low-frequency (f < 0.6 kHz) zonal flows are observed in regions of increased E_r, suggesting substantial contribution of zonal flows to the spatial modulation of E_r radial profiles. Radial localization of zonal flows is correlated with a region of zero magnetic shear and low-order (7/5) rational surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
              "9   We consider string theory on the Lorentzian Melvin geometry, which is obtained by analytically continuing the two-parameter Euclidean Melvin background. Because this model provides a solvable conformal field theory that describes time-dependent twisted string dynamics, we study the string one-loop partition function and the D-brane spectrum. We found that both the wrapping D2-brane and the codimension-one D-string emit winding strings, and this behavior can be traced to the modified open string Hamiltonian on these probe D-branes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
              "10  We link the structure of nuclei around $^{100}$Sn, the heaviest doubly magic nucleus with equal neutron and proton numbers ($N=Z=50$), to nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) and three-nucleon ($NNN$) forces constrained by data of few-nucleon systems. Our results indicate that $^{100}$Sn is doubly magic, and we predict its quadrupole collectivity. We present precise computations of $^{101}$Sn based on three-particle--two-hole excitations of $^{100}$Sn, and reproduce the small splitting between the lowest $J^\\\\pi=7/2^+$ and $5/2^+$ states.

              "11  Theoretical models have suggested peculiar velocity dispersion profiles of star clusters facing dissolution. They predicted that, besides bound stars that still belong to the star cluster, and unbound ones already stripped off, there is an intermediate population of stars that having acquired the enough energy to escape the cluster are still within the cluster Jacobi radius. Both, potential escapers and unbound stars, show hot kinematics, not observed along tidal tails of star clusters. We report on the first evidence of an open cluster with stars crossing such a transitional scenario, namely: ASCC 92. The open cluster gathers nearly 10 percent of its initial total mass, and is moving toward Galactic regions affected by higher interstellar absorption. Precisely, the obscured appearance of the cluster could have hampered disentangling its true internal dynamical evolutionary stage, previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "12  Many machine learning applications are based on data collected from people, such as their tastes and behaviour as well as biological traits and genetic data. Regardless of how important the application might be, one has to make sure individuals' identities or the privacy of the data are not compromised in the analysis. Differential privacy constitutes a powerful framework that prevents breaching of data subject privacy from the output of a computation. Differentially private versions of many important Bayesian inference methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of an efficient unified approach applicable to arbitrary models. In this contribution, we propose a differentially private variational inference method with a very wide applicability. It is built on top of doubly stochastic variational inference, a recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of models. We add differential privacy into doubly stochastic variational inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the method can reach an accuracy close to non-private level under reasonably strong privacy guarantees, clearly improving over previous sampling-based alternatives especially in the strong privacy regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
              "13  Extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) is the task of selecting a small subset of relevant labels from a very large set of possible labels. As such, it is characterized by long-tail labels, i.e., most labels have very few positive instances. With standard performance measures such as precision@k, a classifier can ignore tail labels and still report good performance. However, it is often argued that correct predictions in the tail are more \"interesting\" or \"rewarding,\" but the community has not yet settled on a metric capturing this intuitive concept. The existing propensity-scored metrics fall short on this goal by confounding the problems of long-tail and missing labels. In this paper, we analyze generalized metrics budgeted \"at k\" as an alternative solution. To tackle the challenging problem of optimizing these metrics, we formulate it in the expected test utility (ETU) framework, which aims to optimize the expected performance on a fixed test set. We derive optimal prediction rules and construct computationally efficient approximations with provable regret guarantees and robustness against model misspecification. Our algorithm, based on block coordinate ascent, scales effortlessly to XMLC problems and obtains promising results in terms of long-tail performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
              "14  Altmetrics have led to new quantitative studies of science through social media interactions. However, there are no models of science communication that respond to the multiplicity of non-academic channels. Using the 3653 authors with the highest volume of altmetrics mentions from the main channels (Twitter, News, Facebook, Wikipedia, Blog, Policy documents, and Peer reviews) to their publications (2016-2020), it has been analyzed where the audiences of each discipline are located. The results evidence the generalities and specificities of these new communication models and the differences between areas. These findings are useful for the development of science communication policies and strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
              "15  We have investigated the ferromagnetic phase transition of elemental Co by high-resolution neutron backscattering spectroscopy. We monitored the splitting of the nuclear levels by the hyperfine field at the Co nucleus. The energy of this hyperfine splitting is identified as the order parameter of the ferromagnetic phase transition. By measuring the temperature dependence of the energy we determined the critical exponent $\\\\beta = 0.350 \\\\pm 0.002$ and the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of $T_{\\\\text{C}} = 1400$~K. The present result of the critical exponent agrees better with the predicted value (0.367) of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg model than that determined previously by NMR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
              "16  We adapt Takahashi's modified spin-wave theory to the context of nano-magnets, and apply it to the molecular compound based on the giant magnetic molecule Mo(72)Fe(30). This involves solving numerically the mean-field equations and then forcing the sublattice magnetizations to zero by means of local chemical potentials for the magnons. We have thus constructed a quantum state with no local magnetization at all temperatures, appropriate to a finite-size system, but with strong correlations. We compare theoretical results to specific heat and ESR measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
              "17  In this paper, we study the disentanglement of speaker and language representations in non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS models from various aspects. We propose a phoneme length regulator that solves the length mismatch problem between IPA input sequence and monolingual alignment results. Using the phoneme length regulator, we present a FastPitch-based cross-lingual model with IPA symbols as input representations. Our experiments show that language-independent input representations (e.g. IPA symbols), an increasing number of training speakers, and explicit modeling of speech variance information all encourage non-autoregressive cross-lingual TTS model to disentangle speaker and language representations. The subjective evaluation shows that our proposed model can achieve decent naturalness and speaker similarity in cross-language voice cloning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
              "18  Quantum electrodynamics (qed) is used to derive the differential cross sections measured in the three new experimental internal source ensemble x-ray holographies: bremsstrahlung (BXH), fluorescence (XFH), and multiple-energy (MEXH) x-ray holography. The polarization dependence of the BXH cross section is also obtained. For BXH, we study analytically and numerically the possible effects of the virtual photons and electrons which enter qed calculations in summing over the intermediate states. For the low photon and electron energies used in the current experiments, we show that the virtual intermediate states produce only very small effects. This is because the uncertainty principle limits the distance that the virtual particles can propagate to be much shorter than the separation between the regions of high electron density in the adjacent atoms. We also find that using the asymptotic form of the scattering wave function causes about a 5-10% error for near forward scattering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

              "20  We show that the electron-phonon coupling strength obtained from the slopes of the electronic energy vs. wavevector dispersion relations, as often done in analyzing angle-resolved photoemission data, can differ substantially from the actual electron-phonon coupling strength due to the curvature of the bare electronic bands. This effect becomes particularly important when the Fermi level is close to a van Hove singularity. By performing {\\\\it ab initio} calculations on doped graphene we demonstrate that, while the apparent strength obtained from the slopes of experimental photoemission data is highly anisotropic, the angular dependence of the actual electron-phonon coupling strength in this material is negligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

At the core of CORDIET is the C-K theory which captures the essential elements of innovation. The tool uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Emergent Self Organizing Maps (ESOM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) as main artifacts in the analysis process. The user can define temporal, text mining and compound attributes. The text mining attributes are used to analyze the unstructured text in documents, the temporal attributes use these document's timestamps for analysis. The compound attributes are XML rules based on text mining and temporal attributes. The user can cluster objects with object-cluster rules and can chop the data in pieces with segmentation rules. The artifacts are optimized for efficient data analysis; object labels in the FCA lattice and ESOM map contain an URL on which the user can click to open the selected document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Moreover, we compute the critical current, I_c for given g and Z, and show that it possesses two lines of non-analyticity in the (g, Z)-plane. We identify those regions in the (g, Z)-plane where the Josephson current changes sign with increasing temperature without a change in the relative phase between the two superconductors, i.e., without a transition between a 0 and \\\\pi state of the junction.

              "24  Inferring causal structures from time series data is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. A major barrier to such inference is the problem of subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurement is much lower than that of causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been proposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve identifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without any parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling arises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile, every hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at some observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure. Based on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the hidden variables and hence achieve identifiability. Following this intuition, we propose a proxy-based causal discovery algorithm. Our algorithm is nonparametric and can achieve full causal identification. Theoretical advantages are reflected in synthetic and real-world experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
              "25  In the framework of Lindblad theory for open quantum systems, we calculate the entropy of a damped quantum harmonic oscillator which is initially in a quasi-free state. The maximally predictable states are identified as those states producing the minimum entropy increase after a long enough time. In general, the states with a squeezing parameter depending on the environment's diffusion coefficients and friction constant are singled out, but if the friction constant is much smaller than the oscillator's frequency, coherent states   (or thermalized coherent states) are obtained as the preferred classical states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "26  Multimodal neuroimaging studies of corticobasal syndrome using volumetric MRI and DTI successfully discriminate between Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration but this evidence has typically included clinically heterogeneous patient cohorts and has rarely assessed the network structure of these distinct sources of pathology. Using structural MRI data, we identify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter density in corticobasal syndrome relative to age matched controls. A support vector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly discriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease pathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory power, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the underlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more accurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results highlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic analyses of corticobasal syndrome and suggest that distinct sources of pathology mediate the circuitry of brain regions affected by corticobasal syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
              "27  We study the problem of retrieving data from a channel that breaks the input sequence into a set of unordered fragments of random lengths, which we refer to as the chop-and-shuffle channel. The length of each fragment follows a geometric distribution. We propose nested Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes to recover the data. We evaluate the error rate and the complexity of our scheme numerically. Our results show that the decoding error decreases as the input length increases, and our method has a significantly lower complexity than the baseline brute-force approach. We also propose a new construction for VT codes, quantify the maximum number of the required parity bits, and show that our approach requires fewer parity bits compared to known results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
              "28  The reliability of software that has a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a component is urgently important today given the increasing number of critical applications being deployed with DNNs. The need for reliability raises a need for rigorous testing of the safety and trustworthiness of these systems. In the last few years, there have been a number of research efforts focused on testing DNNs. However the test generation techniques proposed so far lack a check to determine whether the test inputs they are generating are valid, and thus invalid inputs are produced. To illustrate this situation, we explored three recent DNN testing techniques. Using deep generative model based input validation, we show that all the three techniques generate significant number of invalid test inputs. We further analyzed the test coverage achieved by the test inputs generated by the DNN testing techniques and showed how invalid test inputs can falsely inflate test coverage metrics.   To overcome the inclusion of invalid inputs in testing, we propose a technique to incorporate the valid input space of the DNN model under test in the test generation process. Our technique uses a deep generative model-based algorithm to generate only valid inputs. Results of our empirical studies show that our technique is effective in eliminating invalid tests and boosting the number of valid test inputs generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
              "29  We follow the evolution of compact binaries under the coupled effect of tides and stellar winds until the onset of Roche-lobe overflow. These binaries contain a compact object (either a black-hole, a neutron-star, or a planet) and a stellar component. We integrate the full set of tidal equations, which are based on Hut's model for tidal evolution, and we couple them with the angular momentum loss in a stellar wind. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we wish to highlight some interesting evolutionary outcomes of the coupling. When tides are coupled with a non-massive stellar wind, one interesting outcome is that in certain types of binaries, the stellar spin tends to reach a quasi-equilibrium state, where the effect of tides and wind are counteracting each other. When tides are coupled with a massive wind, we parametrize the evolution in terms of the decoupling radius, at which the wind decouples from the star. Even for small decoupling radii this \\\\emph{wind braking} can drive systems on the main sequence to Roche-lobe overflow that otherwise would fail to do so. Our second aim is to inspect whether simple timescale considerations are a good description of the evolution of the systems. We find that simple timescale considerations, which rely on neglecting the coupling between tides and stellar winds, do not accurately represent the true evolution of compact binaries. The outcome of the coupled evolution of the rotational and orbital elements can strongly differ from simple timescale considerations, as already pointed out by Barker & Ogilvie 2009 in the case of short-period planetary systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
              "30  Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for representing the topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both the models and the algorithm that learns them. By taking advantage of such information, learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate better solutions and require fewer iterations, while being robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental results, obtained from both simulated and real robot data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

              "72  In this paper we consider the task of scheduling packet transmissions amongst multiple paths with uncertain, time-varying delay. We make the observation that the requirement is usually to transmit application layer objects (web pages, images, video frames etc) with low latency, and so it is the object delay rather than the per packet delay which is important. This has fundamental implications for multipath scheduler design. We introduce SOS (Stochastic Object-aware Scheduler), the first multipath scheduler that considers application layer object sizes and their relationship to link uncertainty. We demonstrate that SOS reduces the 95% percentile object delivery delay by 50-100% over production WiFi and LTE links compared to state-of-the art schedulers. We extend SOS to utilize FEC and to handle the scheduling multiple objects in parallel. We show that judicious priority scheduling of HTTP objects can lead to a 2-3x improvement in page load times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
              "73  (Abr.) Laser guide stars employed at astronomical observatories provide artificial wavefront reference sources to help correct (in part) the impact of atmospheric turbulence on astrophysical observations. Following the recent commissioning of the 4 Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) on UT4 at the VLT, we characterize the spectral signature of the uplink beams from the 22W lasers to assess the impact of laser scattering from the 4LGSF on science observations. We use the MUSE optical integral field spectrograph to acquire spectra at a resolution of R~3000 of the uplink laser beams over the wavelength range of 4750\\\\AA\\\\ to 9350\\\\AA. We report the first detection of laser-induced Raman scattering by N2, O2, CO2, H2O and (tentatively) CH4 molecules in the atmosphere above the astronomical observatory of Cerro Paranal. In particular, our observations reveal the characteristic spectral signature of laser photons -- but 480\\\\AA\\\\ to 2210\\\\AA\\\\ redder than the original laser wavelength of 5889.959\\\\AA\\\\ -- landing on the 8.2m primary mirror of UT4 after being Raman-scattered on their way up to the sodium layer. Laser-induced Raman scattering is not unique to the observatory of Cerro Paranal, but common to any astronomical telescope employing a laser-guide-star (LGS) system. It is thus essential for any optical spectrograph coupled to a LGS system to handle thoroughly the possibility of a Raman spectral contamination via a proper baffling of the instrument and suitable calibrations procedures. These considerations are particularly applicable for the HARMONI optical spectrograph on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope. At sites hosting multiple telescopes, laser collision prediction tools also ought to account for the presence of Raman emission from the uplink laser beam(s) to avoid the unintentional contamination of observations acquired with telescopes in the vicinity of a LGS system.\n",
              "74  The speed of sound is a novel probe of equation of state and phase transitions in dense cores of neutron stars. Recently nuclear experiments extracted a surprising thick neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb, causing tensions to reproduce the tidal deformability in gravitational-wave observations. This work finds that exotic structures in the speed of sound with a small softening slope followed by a steep-rising peak are required to reconcile the thick neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb with astronomical observations of neutron stars. Furthermore, the peak of speed of sound is narrowly constrained around two times the nuclear saturation density with the thick neutron skin. Consequently early and strong first-order phase transitions are comparatively more favorable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
              "75  Biomarker detection is the key to identifying health risks. However, designing sensitive biosensors in a single-use mode for disease diagnosis remains a major challenge. Here, we report sub-monolayer biolasers with remarkable repeatability for ultrasensitive and disposable biomarker detection. The biolaser sensors are designed by employing the telecom optical fibers as distributed optical microcavities and pushing the gain molecules down to the sub-monolayer level. We observe a status transition from the monolayer biolaser to the sub-monolayer biolaser by tuning the specific conjugation. By reducing the fluorophores down to the threshold density (~ 3.2 x 10-13 mol/cm2), we demonstrate an ultimate sensitivity of sub-monolayer biolaser with six orders of magnitude enhancement compared with the monolayer biolasers. We further achieved ultrasensitive immunoassay for Parkinson's disease biomarker, alpha-synuclein, with a lower limit of detection of 0.32 pM in serum. This biosensor with massive fabrication capability at ultralow cost provides a general method for the ultrasensitive disposable biodetection of disease biomarkers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
              "76  Graphene is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moir\\\\'e superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway towards controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials eliminating need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
              "77  Testing the order of accuracy of (very) high order methods for shallow water (and Euler) equations is a delicate operation and the test cases are the crucial starting point of this operation. We provide a short derivation of vortex-like analytical solutions in 2 dimensions for the shallow water equations (and, hence, Euler equations) that can be used to test the order of accuracy of numerical methods. These solutions have different smoothness in their derivatives (up to $\\\\mathcal C^\\\\infty$) and can be used accordingly to the order of accuracy of the scheme to test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

              "79  In this paper, we propose a transmission mechanism for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) system based on cluster index modulation (CIM), named best-gain optimized cluster selection CIM (BGCS-CIM). The proposed BGCS-CIM scheme considers effective cluster power gain and spatial diversity gain obtained by the additional paths within the indexed cluster to construct an efficient codebook. We also integrate the proposed scheme into a practical system model to create a virtual path between transmitter and receiver where the direct link has been blocked. Thanks to the designed whitening filter, a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error rate (ABER) is derived and used to validate the simulation results. It has been shown that the proposed BGCS-CIM scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks thanks to its higher effective cluster gain, spatial diversity of indexed clusters, and lower inter-cluster interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

We show that even in the interaction-free case correlations exist as long as the two distances at least partially share the same segments. For the interacting case, we demonstrate that the naive expectation of increasing correlations with increasing interaction strength only holds in a finite range of values.

              "81  This work represents a natural coalescence of two important lines of work: learning mixtures of Gaussians and algorithmic robust statistics. In particular we give the first provably robust algorithm for learning mixtures of any constant number of Gaussians. We require only mild assumptions on the mixing weights (bounded fractionality) and that the total variation distance between components is bounded away from zero. At the heart of our algorithm is a new method for proving dimension-independent polynomial identifiability through applying a carefully chosen sequence of differential operations to certain generating functions that not only encode the parameters we would like to learn but also the system of polynomial equations we would like to solve. We show how the symbolic identities we derive can be directly used to analyze a natural sum-of-squares relaxation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "82  We have detected [C I] 3P1-3P0 emissions in the gaseous debris disks of 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris with the 10 m telescope of the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment, which is the first detection of such emissions. The line profiles of [C I] are found to resemble those of CO(J=3-2) observed with the same telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This result suggests that atomic carbon (C) coexists with CO in the debris disks, and is likely formed by the photodissociation of CO. Assuming an optically thin [C I] emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100 K, the column density of C is evaluated to be (2.2+-0.2)x10^17 and (2.5+-0.7)x10^16 cm^-2 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. The C/CO column density ratio is thus derived to be 54+-19 and 69+-42 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. These ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and diffuse clouds by an order of magnitude. The unusually high ratios of C to CO are likely attributed to a lack of H2 molecules needed to reproduce CO molecules efficiently from C. This result implies a small number of H2 molecules in the gas disk; i.e., there is an appreciable contribution of secondary gas from dust grains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "83  We consider an involutive automorphism of the conformal algebra and the resulting symmetric space. We display a new action of the conformal group which gives rise to this space. The space has an intrinsic symplectic structure, a group-invariant metric and connection, and serves as the model space for a new conformal gauge theory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
              "84  In this paper we describe the derivations of orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras over a superring. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions under which the derivations can be expressed as a semidirect product of inner and outer derivations.

              "85  It is crucial to understand the extreme intermittency of ocean and lake turbulence and turbulent mixing in order to estimate vertical fluxes of momentum, heat and mass by Osborn-Cox flux-dissipation methods. Vast undersampling errors occur by this method when intermittency is not taken into account. Oceanic turbulence increases intermittency as the result of a self-similar nonlinear cascade covering a wide range of scales, mostly horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for Galactic and oceanic turbulence are in the range 3-7. These values are consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of Kolmogorov (1962) and a length scale range over 3-7 decades from viscous or diffusive to buoyancy or Coriolis force domination, where the measured universal intermittency constant m_u = 0.44, Gibson (1991a), is a result of singularities in multifractal turbulence dissipation networks and their degeneration, Bershadskii and Gibson (1994). Nonlinear cascades of gravitational structure formation produce intermittent lognormal number densities of cosmological objects for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
              "86  It is shown that the qualitative model of the high-temperature superconductivity suggested earlier for cuprates and doped picene and based on the idea that the valence electron state depends on the character of the chemical bonds they form and on the Coulomb interaction between the electrons is not only confirmed by the experimental data on iron pnictides but is also improved. From the chemical point of view, the high-temperature superconductivity is associated with additional $\\\\pi$ bonding along chains of covalently bonded ions via a delocalized $\\\\pi$ orbital, just like in cuprates. From the physical point of view, as the data on iron pnictides show, the superconductivity is associated with a FeAs layer transition into the state similar to a macroscopic quantum system characterized by a highly correlated electron state, formation of two-dimensional crystals of electron pairs with quantized energy levels, and a strong Coulomb interaction between these crystals. Superconductivity in such a system is accomplished by a two-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional Wigner crystals formed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same quasi-one-dimensional state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to a delocalized $\\\\pi$ orbital in chemistry. The model applicability to three different classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides) indicates that it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity taking into consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and strong Coulomb interactions between the electrons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

              "88  The presence of stratified layer in atmosphere and ocean leads to buoyant vertical motions, commonly referred to as plumes. It is important to study the mixing dynamics of a plume at a local scale in order to model their evolution and growth. Such a characterization requires measuring the velocity and density of the mixing fluids simultaneously. Here, we present the results of a buoyant plume propagating in a linearly stratified medium with a density difference of 0.5%, thus yielding a buoyancy frequency of N=0.15 s^{-1}. To understand the plume behaviour, statistics such as centerline and axial velocities along varying downstream locations, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and buoyancy flux were measured. The centerline velocity was found to decrease with increase in height. The Reynolds stress and buoyancy flux profiles showed the presence of a unstable layer and the mixing associated within that layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
              "89  Using a near-field microwave technique, two-dimensional images have been made of the second and third order intermodulation distortion (IMD) of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 and YBa2Cu3O7 thin film microwave resonators. It was found that second and third order IMD do not have identical spatial distributions, which indicates that physical mechanisms play different roles in their generation. This technique enables the investigation of the roles of these mechanisms. As an illustration, the sensitivity to magnetic fluxons of the two orders is described, with second order being more sensitive to fluxon density.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
              "90  Polyimide-based materials, like Kapton, are widely used in flexible cables and circuitry due to their unique electrical and mechanical characteristics. This study is aimed at investigating the radiopurity of Kapton for use in ultralow background, rare-event physics applications by measuring the $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th, and $^{nat}$K levels using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Commercial-off-the-shelf Kapton varieties, measured at approximately 950 and 120 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (1.2$\\\\times$10$^4$ and 490 $\\\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively, can be a significant background source for many current and next-generation ultralow background detectors. This study has found that the dominant contamination is due to the use of dicalcium phosphate (DCP), a nonessential slip additive added during manufacturing. Alternative Kapton materials were obtained that did not contain DCP and were determined to be significantly more radiopure than the commercially-available options with 12 and 19 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (150 and 77 $\\\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively. The lowest radioactivity version produced (Kapton ELJ, which contains an adhesive) was found to contain single digit pg/g levels of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, two-to-three orders of magnitude cleaner than commercial-off-the-shelf options. Moreover, copper-clad polyimide laminates employing Kapton ELJ as the insulator were obtained and shown to be very radiopure at 8.6 and 22 pg/g $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th (110 and 89 $\\\\mu$Bq/kg), respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Taking into account temperature dependences of the gluon condensates extracted from lattice thermodynamics for the pure SU(3) system, we find that the mass and width of J/psi exhibit rapid change across the critical temperature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

We find the latter to be impure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "93  Single-molecule magnets facilitate the study of quantum tunneling of magnetization at the mesoscopic level. The spin-parity effect is among the fundamental predictions that have yet to be clearly observed. It is predicted that quantum tunneling is suppressed at zero transverse field if the total spin of the magnetic system is half-integer (Kramers degeneracy) but is allowed in integer spin systems. The Landau-Zener method is used to measure the tunnel splitting as a function of transverse field. Spin-parity dependent tunneling is established by comparing the transverse field dependence of the tunnel splitting of integer and half-integer spin systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "94  Anisotropy data analysis leaves a significant degeneracy between primeval spectral index (n_s) and cosmic opacity to CMB photons (\\\\tau). Low--l polarization measures, in principle, can remove it. We perform a likelihood analysis to see how cosmic variance possibly affects such a problem. We find that, for a sufficiently low noise level (\\\\sigma_{pix}) and if \\\\tau is not negligibly low, the degeneracy is greatly reduced, while the residual impact of cosmic variance on n_s and \\\\tau determinations is under control. On the contrary, if \\\\sigma_{pix} is too high, cosmic variance effects appear to be magnified. We apply general results to specific experiments and find that, if favorable conditions occur, it is possible that a 2--\\\\sigma detection of a lower limit on \\\\tau is provided by the SPOrt experiment. Furthermore, if the PLANCK experiment will measure polarization with the expected precision, the error on low--l harmonics is adequate to determine \\\\tau, without significant magnification of the cosmic variance. This however indicates that high sensitivity might be more important than high resolution in \\\\tau determinations. We also outline that a determination of \\\\tau is critical to perform detailed analyses on the nature of dark energy and/or on the presence of primeval gravitational waves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

              "96  Black-hole driven relativistic astrophysical jets, such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), are powerful sources of electromagnetic radiation. Their emission is powered by some energy dissipation and particle acceleration mechanism operating in-situ at large distances from the black hole. We propose that the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by the time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic field lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may have their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized by an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it is a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form between the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers further jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of stripe widths $l>l_{\\\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\\\rm min}$. We find that the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the stripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks at a distance $z_{\\\\rm peak}\\\\sim 10^6 R_g\\\\, (\\\\Gamma_\\\\infty/30)^2\\\\, (l_{\\\\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where $R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\\\\Gamma_{\\\\infty}$ the jet's asymptotic Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by $\\\\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in distance. The prolonged energy dissipation accounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength spectra commonly observed in jets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of blazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to ~100 pc scales. In GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the photopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components.           \n",

The vertices are replaced by unity while each propagator becomes a dual superconformal `R-invariant' whose arguments may be read off from the diagram. The momentum twistor MHV rules generate a formula for the full, all-loop planar integrand of the super Yang-Mills S-matrix that is manifestly dual superconformally invariant up to the choice of a reference twistor. We give a general proof of this reformulation and illustrate its use by computing the momentum twistor NMHV and NNMHV tree amplitudes and the integrands of the MHV and NMHV 1-loop and the MHV 2-loop planar amplitudes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
              "99  Solar flares are regularly detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite, however no gamma-ray emission from other stellar eruptions has ever been captured. The Swift detection in April 2014 of a powerful outburst originating from DG CVn, with associated optical and radio emissions, enticed us to search for possible 0.1-100 GeV emission from this flaring nearby binary star using the Fermi/LAT. No gamma-ray emission is detected from DG CVn in 2014, but we report a significant gamma-ray excess in November 2012, at a position consistent with that of the binary. There are no reports of contemporary flaring at other wavelengths from DG CVn or any other source within the error circle of the gamma-ray source. We argue that the gamma-ray flare is more likely to have been associated with a background blazar than with DG CVn and identify a candidate for follow-up study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "100 Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system monitored by a network of sensors, modeled as nodes of an underlying directed communication graph. We study the problem of collaboratively estimating the state of the system when certain nodes are compromised by adversaries. Specifically, we consider a Byzantine adversary model, where a compromised node possesses complete knowledge of the system dynamics and the network, and can deviate arbitrarily from the rules of any prescribed algorithm. We first characterize certain fundamental limitations of any distributed state estimation algorithm in terms of the measurement and communication structure of the nodes. We then develop an attack-resilient, provably correct state estimation algorithm that admits a fully distributed implementation. To characterize feasible network topologies that guarantee success of our proposed technique, we introduce a notion of `strong-robustness' that captures both measurement and communication redundancy. Finally, by drawing connections to bootstrap percolation theory, we argue that given an LTI system and an associated sensor network, the `strong-robustness' property can be checked in polynomial time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
